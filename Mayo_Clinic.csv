"1","Stacey C.","Indianapolis, IN",5,"I only have good things to say about Mayo.  A family member was diagnosed by their  local doctor with a condition that required surgery to correct.  Several local doctors preform this surgery occasionally buy not routinely so we contacted Mayo where they have a specialist who focuses on this procedure and does over 300 a year.  We transmitted the records and tests electronically, had phone consultations, scheduled a week long visit.  All of the staff was professional, engaging, and seemed to honestly care about their job and the patients.  The cross coordination, communication, and care are so different than typically health care."
"2","Arin W.","Chicago, IL",1,"The clinic might be great. I'll never know because they rejected me via form email that told me to ""keep perusing local options"" after making me jump through many hoops and having me sign upfor the patient portal which I now have no use for.  Also the person on the phone kept interrupting me and flatly saying ""I need something that I can put in as a code"".Both the phone calls I had were unsympathetic and frankly a waste. I'd bet money no actual person looked at my paperwork. Just a machine that scanned for keywords. It gets worse. My parents got in easy breezy for Executive Physicals which are extensive but only available to executives and their spouses. Which makes zero sense. (Hint: the answer is elitism)"
"3","Jessica S.","Kansas City, MO",5,"It's hard to put into words the size of this place. Amazing medical center with top notch doctors, nurses, and all the support staff. A collaborative effort from all involved."
"4","Fran H.","San Francisco, CA",1,"Received a text saying I missed my appt with my provider. Problem is I haven't even been set up to see a provider. So I called and was not very happy with Missy in General Internal Medicine. A little kindness and an apology for the error, rather than insist it was a phone call from central that I failed to pick up, would have been sufficient. I asked why they didn't leave a VM? ""Is there anything else you need?"" was Missy's reply. Absolutely not."
"5","Annie R.","Denver, CO",1,"I moved here for a surgery. I had a tumor on my adrenal gland, and they couldn't figure out what it was. These tumors are notoriously hard to diagnose. My endocrinologist, Dr. Naan, who is the head of the department, was disrespectful and didn't take my case seriously. The first time I saw her, we did nothing. As we were standing up to leave she tells me that 1/3 of tumors like mine are benign, and she says that like it's a good thing. I stopped and said that this means 2/3 are malignant, and she just says ""yup"" and continues walking out the door. I was in shock. I'm only 36 y.o., and I had been told previously that it was probably benign. I never thought a doctor, let alone a department head, would be that flippant about telling me I had a 2/3 chance of having cancer. Next session, I told her I was really stressed about that, and I had spent an hour w a friend talking about it. Dr Naan replied ""uh oh, I hope you weren't drinking"". So, apparently Mayo Clinic department heads think patients have to be drunk to be worried about having a 2/3 chance of cancer. She was beyond dehumanizing. My surgeon, Dr McKenzie, didn't do any education during our surgical consult pertaining to the surgical procedure, what I can expect to happen during surgery, or the risks of surgery. I wrote a review, that was supposed to be confidential, detailing the things he left out. The resident came to see me the day off the surgery and educated me on exactly the things I mentioned in my anonymous review, nothing more, nothing less. He didn't tell me I'd have a catheter placed inside me during the operation, and no one told me after either. I only found out bc I was urinating blood, and because of the pain. Neither my endocrinologist or surgeon made any plans to follow up with me after surgery to discuss what the mass is, and the surgeon wrote explicitly in his notes that a follow up visit was not needed....so no one had plans to follow up and tell me what the mass was. And they didn't. I had some questions that I messaged them, a resident called back to answer my questions, but he never mentioned what the mass was until I asked. Then he said he was going to bring it up. The tumor wasn't in the same place they thought it was, it was actually outside the adrenal gland, and the resident said the adrenal gland would have died anyway, if they had just resected the tumor and not the whole gland. However, the tumor was not even inside the adrenal gland. No one told me that either. I read it in a report, and I brought it up to the resident. The resident said the surgeon didn't bring it up because the surgeon could not differentiate between tumor and regular adrenal gland. This surgeon does many, many adrenal resections each year, he's regarded as highly skilled, and he's does do partial adrenalectomies...so how is it possible that this surgeon could not differentiate between normal adrenal gland and a tumor that's sitting outside but adjacent to the adrenal? The surgeon just didn't want to educate me on anything that a normal patient would want to know -surgery risks, surgery outcomes, etc. I really wanted just the tumor removed, and Dr Naan mentioned that she wasn't sure the tumor was inside the adrenal, but the surgeon never said anything about that. The resident said that no one could have known that the tumor was outside the gland. Between Dr Naan and Dr McKenzie, it's just more dehumanizing bs than I can take. This is hard enough, but add on doctors like them who obviously don't care about my case at all, and the process becomes exponentially worse. I cannot believe I moved out here, to try to get better care, and ended up with doctors like these two who have been so offensive and absent on my case. Choosing Mayo was a huge mistake, and I don't recommend them. Go somewhere else, anywhere else, where they treat people like humans."

Would not recommend but would find someone who is a specialist in the field in which you need help.Btw, a few months ago I was accepted but couldn't go.  I re-applied with sameConditions and they said nothing.  I had to call.  They""?   The Wizard of Oz person behind the curtain?  No, not that good.

I had hope for this place but no more.  No more."
"8","William W.","Pisgah, OH",1,"Still having GERD & LPR symptoms after having surgery elsewhere. I sat on a 3 month appointment with Mayo clinic looking for answers. all they said was keep taking PPI's. NO! NO NO NO. stop pushing pills at people. ACTUALLY examine me or look at what's going on. I ended up with a TIF surgery in July 2021, and it failed 6-8 weeks later because that surgeon didn't do a Hiatal Hernia fix at the same time. Feels like putting a knot in a shoelace and pulling it through the same eyelet. Tried to get another opinion from Mayo clinic. the woman on the phone said ""will this appointment require surgery""? I DONT KNOW THAT! then she said there are no appointments available for 3 months so keep calling back.Sorry that you are so overwhelmed right now, but at least TRY to service the people who come to you for help."
"9","Stephanie P.","West Des Moines, IA",5,"Omg... amazing medical center.  So kind and helpful.  It was a top notch experience all the way around.  The doctors listen to the patients and the staff love their jobs and it shows in the total experience.  I would recommend this place to anyone who feels hopeless and is out of options..."
"10","Dan B.","Orinda, CA",5,"Amazing place.  Brilliant doctors who collaborate to find solutions for any individual.  You don't work with just doctor, you actually work with all needed to address your illness.The nurses are amazing. I was in ICU from open heart surgery and the nurses were on their game working with the doctors.  Just super impressive."
"11","Katie N.","Fort Dodge, IA",5,"I showed up in the ER because I was in a lot of pain and feeling sick from the pain.  Twice in a lot of pain, the doctor  had given good pain medicine.  Even when I ended up with really bad panic attacks and unable to do the MRI, they didn't get upset with me and just went based on what they did get to compare with the one from 2 months before.They got someone from the Spine Center to talk to me and help me.  They seem like they care about their patients.   Good hospital."
"12","Karen H.","Fort Lauderdale, FL",1,"I made an appointment on line for my 91 yo dad. They called me back to say that there were no appointments for neurology because of huge demand. They don't do complete work ups . I called customer experience to complain that i couldnt get an appointment there for my father . Shannon in customer experience wouldnt talk to me saying it was against hippa violations. As a lawyer and a nurse I can assure you making an appointment for a patient does not violate hippa. They have no pt info on file to share therefore no violation. She has no idea about what she is telling  potential customers . The whole experience was ridiculous and just from my initial experience I would never recommend a patient seek treatment there.    They also said they dont take medicare patients even if they have the most expensive and best supplements and means to pay out of pocket. ."
"13","Bailey M.","Mount Hope, KS",1,"Today I had one of my most frustrating and pointless appointments of my life. I traveled from Texas to Rochester for an appointment due to 8 years of health issues and struggling to get out of bed each day. I was sent to an endrocrinologist from the neurology department and I was so excited. I have so many health issues and a lot of it seems to be hormone based. I had an appointment with Diana S Dean. I brought a typed and printed list of all my issues. She high fived with me with her elbow 4 times, muttered to herself, took one look at my list and handed it to my husband. Asked if I wanted to be referred to the PCOS clinic, which I said yes to, I'll see as many doctors as I can while in the area. Then she stood up, said I don't think you have hypo or hyper thyroidism right now and walked out the door. That was it. No help at all. There is SO MUCH more to endrocrinolgy than that. Then we walked out to get the PCOS appointment scheduled and they are booked out solid. So here I am.... having spend $3,000 between flights, hotel and car rental... and I didn't get any help. Devastated doesn't begin to cover it. The Neurologist I saw was great but only confirmed I have chronic migraines and they are not curable. She referred me to the gastro department, women's health and chronic pain. However, they are all booked. So they want me to come back in a few months and even then 2 of the 3 are not accepting appointments. So I came all this way and I booked a week stay as the coordinator told me to and no one is helping. If this is how they function they should have a phone consultation for the first appointment and then set up all the doctors for you for one week. This frustrating, heart breaking and I have never been more disappointed in the medical system. And this is supposed to be the #1 hospital in America?? Posting photos to be seen. Beautiful campus. Gardener is doing great but other than that I am gut wrenched over this trip."
"14","Michelle F.","Hesperia, CA",5,"Best hospital experience ever. Friendly knowledgeable staff that take the time to listen and understand your concerns. We traveled from out of state and had all of our appts during the same week, we even added lab work and a movement lab that were done at the last minute. If you have the option of using this facility....do it!"
"15","George K.","Rio Vista, CA",1,"You are a horrible, horrible organization that poses as giving hope to solve health issues and played that game with us for a year and a half, then played GOD and took that hope away after we spent over $10,000.00 and insurance and medicare spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. Shame on you for taking advantage of us and insurance company and taxpayer dollars."
"16","Sue B.","MO, MO",2,"Have been a patient at Mayo in Rochester for over three decades.  In all of that time I've had very few negative experiences. Just recently I had an exchange with a highly rated Dr. Viggiano I had never seen or met before.  I arrived for a procedure and was told after well more than an hour it could not be completed.  The doctor who was apparently to do the procedure appeared at the side of the bed they were in the process of putting me in. I was halfway on the bed as he came around to the left of me, stood very close to my face,  and,  in a VERY loud voice, explained they were not going to be able to do that procedure and went on to explain why in a  loud and condescending voice. This  took place in the recovery and the room you get ready to go to the procedure. it was not a large room and I am convinced that anyone in that room could've heard him shouting. I'm not sure what upset him but I clearly did. Afterwards,  I thought he assumed because I am older,  I was deaf and feeble minded. It was a most upsetting time and I hope somebody said something after I left.  While I was disappointed the procedure had to be rescheduled, that is clearly NOT what I am upset about."
"17","David H.","Traverse City, MI",3,"Dissapointed. A grueling week of very expensive tests. At the end of the week I had a consult with one doctor for less then an hour to review the findings. He only talked about one of the tests. I have to assume all the other tests were fine. But I am not sure how fine. Also, there will be no follow-up, on-site or remotely, for questions or concerns or next steps. Sometimes Mayo seems like very large, very efficient money machine. They are VERY good at sending you to a lot of tests; but not so good at telling you what the results were or what they mean, or in decribing what your path forward might be, or in providing any ongoing follow-up. If you want some great testing, in a well oiled machine; this is your place. If you want some detailed analysis of your issue, and ongoing support, you will need to find that seperately. All the best, David"
"18","Aleyysha A.","North San Jose, San Jose, CA",1,"They charged me for reviews of exams that i did not ask them to. When asked they said they deem necessary to. I said if i have to pay for them i should have been informed but no one informed me. They claim the dr during the tele visit had told me there is a charge for review. I told them to take a look at the video. It is INCORRECt. The dr never said that. They said they dont record tele visits. The doctors can say whatever tjey want but the patient is always wrong. This is unfair and i would recommend to stay away from mayo clinic. There is sonething shady about these people.. The dr in her written notes said she will have her assistance send some brochures which were never sent.The dr said she will call me once the review of requested imaging is done. She never called me back!! Instead expected me to figure out that i should check for her message in their portal.Disorgainized, shady, daying things that were never said/done. I would not recommend them.."
"19","Stephanie M.","Madison, WI",5,"AMAZING!! This is by far and away the best hospital I've ever been to and received treatment at. The staff are friendly and helpful, and they actually go out of your way to make sure you receive the proper care. It's a nice change of pace from the local hospital that I would see my doctor at which took forever to get an appointment."
"20","Teri D.","Baton Rouge, LA",1,"As a retired nurse practitioner, I had always heard how ""awesome""  and wonderful Mayo Clinic is.I was looking into a clinical trial and had all the tests, diagnostics and records.  Mayo charged me over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS to read the eight pages of records and then repeated every test I'd already had LESS THAN TWO WEEKS BEFORE COMING TO MAYO and charged me another TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS for that.  Then I got to see a doctor for about 10 minutes for FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS more and was sent on my way with literally nothing other that the results of the tests which were identical to the ones I sent to Mayo, with the bonus of a huge dose of CT radiation that is totally contraindicated since I have Li-Frau syndrome--which was on the records Mayo charged me 2 grand to read.I was totally unimpressed with Mayo when I was there in February 2020.  Mayo is a ridiculously overpriced medical mill that has no interest in anything other than generating revenue and churning out unneeded medical tests and other crap. I would rather go to a veterinarian than a Mayo Clinic doctor.  I would get better care."
"21","Helen B.","Kansas City, MO",1,"Have been a Mayo patient for over three decades. My experiences over the past year have led me to conclude that the high level of patient care I experienced in the past has somehow changed drastically for the worst. Yes,  I wrote the office of Patient Experience. Worthless. Did not even address the issue I wrote about and transferred  the blame to a department who were not even an issue.  I am disappointed in the care, lack of information, communication, and follow-up."
"22","Garrett R.","New York, NY",5,"It's #1 in the world for a reason. Top care and amazing facilities."
"23","Deborah W.","Concord, NC",1,"""top rated in the nation""??? Surprised that the Mayo Clinic is known to be one of the top rated cancer facilities in the nation. With that being said, we DID NOT receive ""top rated"" care.  Traveled from NC to Florida to hopefully get some help. My brother has cancer and made the drive for an appointment scheduled for 01/05/2022.  We received a call early morning on the day of the appointment to find out the Dr that he was schedule to see was ""showing signs of Covid"", which I can assure you isn't our complaint. However, he was scheduled with another physician, Dr. Jones.  This ""doctor"" did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! DID NOT even exam my brother !! Had a ""cocky"" attitude. Showed zero compassion, and needs his arrogance taken down a few notches. While the nurse was trying to talk, he basically ran her out of the room. What an absolute disappointment, waste of time, not to mention the money that this trip cost (which is the least of our concerns) and I can't express enough just how let down we feel. The young folks that work at Chick-Fil-A show more kindness and compassion than this doctor and I walk away feeling better about life!But not here!!!!"
"24","Jamison T.","Austin, TX",5,"I have been a MC patient since 2019. I had open heart surgery there in 2020. Their dental specialty department is awesome! I go there for all my medical issues. Every department runs like a well oiled machine. There is a reason they are best in world."
"25","pam m.","IL, IL",5,"I was diagnosed with cancer on 2020, during the height of Covid.  The hospitals in Chicago told me there was not they could do.  Maybe clinical trials.  I got an appointment at Mayo, and I am still here.  They can't cure the cancer, but they can treat it.  All of the staff, from the screeners to the Doctors.  Are very caring and loving.  God bless Mayo and all of the staff."
"26","Philip M.","Hallandale Beach, FL",5,"I am a retired urologic surgeon who has visited the clinic in Rochester 19 times since 2009 for various cardiologic, urologic, neurological and dermatologic diagnoses. Cardiac surgery performed in 2009 saved my life and corrected right heart failure. I did my surgical training at a world famous hospital and it cannot even be compared to the superb quality of care I have received at Mayo. I have been so impressed with the quality and compassionate care at Mayo that I immediately became what the institution calls a ""Major Benefactor"". In all my visits every single physician, nurse, and ancillary staff with whom I have interacted has been nothing else but courteous, compassionate, and desirous of returning me to good health. Follow up questions I may have had were promptly answered on my patient portal by my physicians. Could that be because I am a physician? Could be but I have recommended many of my relatives to Mayo and they have all been equally impressed."
"27","Bon H.","Miami, FL",5,"Cannot emphasize enough how great Mayo was! The staff, from the reception desks to the nurses to the techs to the doctors - they were wonderful! Our 15 year-old daughter has a chronic pain condition and was dealing with several other health concerns. We had to have different tests and the schedule changed frequently. It was a good thing because they knew what to do and what would be most helpful for our girl. The staff bent over backwards to make sure they got her in to see the right specialists and get the right tests. Super friendly people and a great place to get results! So thankful we had the opportunity to go!"
"28","Stan E.","San Francisco, CA",1,"dont listen to rumors about this bs clinic!!we have been told clinic in rochester will help my dad post stroke rehab,but clinic only takes easy cases for huge money,and personal are liars!!!if you got crazy money,go and waist there!!!!!"
"29","Bob B.","Denver, CO",5,"Great place to go too for sure I you have the time. To spend. I was there 10 days and were were lucky to         abable to see all their doctors  in such a short window li gave them Open dates to attend so they got to close when they wanted to see me. I learned a lot about the Mayo @ Mayo very interesting facility for sure. They diffidently had their act together over all ten days I learned a great deal about myself o did not know- I'm wondering kid really should have went oh well At least  now I know !?!??"
"30","Courtney C.","Homestead, Plano, TX",1,"I had the worst experience of my life here.  I've had a lifelong illness that I'm am trying to figure out what it is, and the doctor just laughed at all my symptoms and told me I was making stuff up.  He did nothing after only one test came back normal.  He refused to do anything else after here.  I highly do NOT recommend this place at all."
"31","Thiyagarajan C.","Folsom, CA",1,"Had an appointment with Dr Andrew J Barkmeier, Retina specialist at the Rochester campus. Based on the visit it was evident that he didn't read the medical history. He got annoyed when I asked him questions and was totally inconsiderate. I had expressed this to the office of patient experience to which they responded saying, they did not find anything wrong and diagnosis was correct. They did not address the main concern of my complaint. I also realized contacting office of patient experience is useless. I hope others don't get treated like this."
"32","Timothy T.","Farmingdale, NJ",5,"Anyone can go to Mayo providing you have health insurance; pretty tough without. You don't have to ""know"" someone nor do you have to be referred by your local physician. I am lucky to be in pretty good health overall but physicals given to me over the years by my primary care doc, have left me with the feeling that it seemed cursory, and a vague feeling that they may have overlooked something. A good friend of mine goes here every year and suggested I come along. You tell Mayo the issues that concern you, tell them how long you are available, and they set up appointments. In my case I was there from Monday to Friday. They give you your complete itinerary for the week complete with what building, floor, room, time, what to bring, etc. At first glance one may be overwhelmed by where to go but there are literally signs everywhere. If that's not enough friendly staff are more than eager to show you where to go or what you need to know. The Mayo Clinic is comprised of many buildings mostly connected via underground walkways or over surface skyways. It's like a miniature indoor city with people from all over the world bustling from appointment to appointment. There's artwork everywhere and you just may walk through an atrium where someone is playing the baby grand. On a couple of occasions I spent over 90 minutes just talking to a doctor; that does not happen at home. The level of expertise here is staggering plus you are treated quite well and they listen to what you have to say. I had some free time and took a guided tour of Mayo. It included the museum and information about the 100 year + history of the Clinic."
"33","Rebecca W.","Tempe, AZ",5,"I went to the Mayo Clinic ER because of my COVID symptoms and let me tell you! My experience was exceptional! From the moment I came in, I felt cared for by Anthony and Melissa who wheeled me to the ER. Jenny was very kind as she set me up in room 25, and Nurse Maria C took it from there. She is the kindest, most compassionate human I've met in a while. She made me feel like I was one of her own and made sure I knew my rights, knew what was happening and why, made sure I was comfortable, and help set me up with transportation because I walked to the hospital in the first place. She made me feel safe, cared for, and valued. I am so thankful to have met her, let alone been in her care. While she was helping me, a wonderful woman named Alex helped me with my EVP (I think that's what it's called?) and she was also a kind soul.Nurse Maria and everyone else here are hero's, fighting the good fight. I will always remember my experience at the Mayo Clinic. Thank you so much!"
"34","Marcia B.","Medina, WA",1,"This was a total waste of time, effort, and money!After waiting over a year, I visited this institution for an unusual condition that I had suffered from daily. I received testing for some rare but, easily known conditions that I do not have and knew I did not have before the testing! The neurologist that I saw STILL cannot come to terms with the fact that I experience neurological TREMORS and not HEART PALPITATIONS! He did an incredibly foul job of directing my care; did not have me see and endocrinologist and the cardiologist I saw was so junior and superficial that he was more concerned with my weight than the condition that brought me to Mayo (and caused my weight gain). I was and still am in extreme physical distress daily and received NO help whatsoever from my interaction with this institution. Instead I was run through the massive machine of Mayo by a neurologist who is so past his expiration date that he cannot repeat back what is said to him nor track email correspondence properly and who RELENTLESSLY PROJECTS imaged dialogue into our conversations. The only time he is awakened is when his ego is affected. This institution is a DEVASTATING DISAPPOINTMENT!!! (And yes, I know that all caps mean I am yelling but, when you suffer relentlessly and the folks at Mayo lose you in the cogs of their treatment rhythms, diagnostic projections, practitioner ego, and bureaucracy, you would want to yell too!) What they have given me is more despair and sorrow to overcome on top of my already challenging condition!Go there if you need to but, do so with your eyes open!!!"

They DON'T CARE !Unprofessional, cruel and difunctional institution!"
"36","Megan T.","Alhambra, CA",5,"I visited here just to walk around and look at everything this place has to offer. I did not receive any treatment here. But the hospital is huge and interesting to walk through. They have a beautiful meditation room. There is an interesting store that offers educational health books that I ended up buying 2 of. There is an educational room where they have human diagrams and models to look at and interact with. There are also a ton of pamphlets and DVDs on diseases, disorders, and healthier lifestyles. I really loved this room because they offered so many informational materials on all the chronic diseases and disorders that the U.S. face."

"40","Neal M.","Grand Forks, ND",1,"I had a cervical spinal stenosis surgery in March of 2012 by Dr. William Krauss, the head of the Neuro-surgery department. The surgery was supposed to be minimally invasive but when I woke up from the nearly 5 hour surgery, my left arm and leg were paralyzed. Another 5 hour surgery the next day partially restored some movement. He did a corpectomy on C4-C5-C6 and fusion with a metal plate and screws. The second surgery was a laminectomy of C4-C5-C6 to try to relieve pressure at that level.Since then, I have been in severe burning nerve pain.  I have been to several doctors and tried everything to relieve the pain. Most recently, a spinal cord stimulator that didn't help either.Mayo Clinic has 200 lawyers on staff to hide cases such as mine. They only allow good will to be spread about themselves. Some have called it ""Mayo-naisse"".I tried to sue them but two super lawyers in Minneapolis wouldn't even try to go after Mayo.It seems you basically sign your life away when you go there fir help. I just wanted to be able to enjoy my life. I'm 66 now and just hoping I don't have to live much longer like this. Severe 24/7 pain wears on a person.If I could go back in time, I would have had my surgery performed by a competent surgeon. My current neurosurgeon has fixed many of Dr. Krauss' mistakes. He was unable to fix mine however.So, I am doomed to taking pills every 6 hours 24/7. Even with the medications,  my pain level remains around an 8 on the 1-10 scale. Some days are worse."

Yes.  There cherry pick cases. If you don't get accepted consider it a blessing.  The ""staff"" are the priority. Malpractice abounds even before you get thru intake.  They hung up on the patient.   Saying more would just waste my time.  Mayo is dead.  Get ready to accept that this American icon is a fraud.  Run. Do not give them access to cash. Had Medicare thankfully.  They use the word help. I just want them to do their jobs.  So sad. Speechless.  World class in their own minds! No class. Zero empathy, sensitivity or training. They hung up on a patient with severe cognitive depression.  Hung up on the patient.  Hung up on the patient.  Lost count how many times they hung up on me.  I don't forgive or forget this abusive treatment.  So many princess enablers!  The mayo is dead.  Not for profit . Lmao Only for their profit.  Do not use out of pocket money unless you're bezos rich!!!!"
"42","Jessica T.","Milwaukee, WI",5,"I came to the Mayo Clinic for the Executive health program where over the span of a few days a variety of appointments are scheduled.  I had heard about this program from a colleague.  The appointments set for you are based off a questionnaire you fill out when scheduling your visit.  Please note they book out many months in advance! I checked into a nearby hotel on Monday night and took a shuttle to the Mayo Clinic bright & early Tuesday morning.  I went to the 5th floor to the executive health area and checked in. I was given a tablet and a pager and was instructed to answer the questionnaire on the tablet. I did this and then waited patiently for my 7:30 appointment with the doctor who was going to oversee my file.  I was taken back by a nurse to give my list of supplements/vitamins/medications and weight as well as my blood pressure.  The doctor then came and spent an hour with me going through my medical history. He took his time, which was great!  Now that they are on the Epic system, he was able to pull my records from almost 20 years back. That was pretty impressive! After my time with the doctor I was told we would do a follow up call on Friday as he knew I wanted to drive home on Thursday night. I then went to a series of appointments throughout the day and finally when I got hungry I inquired on where to buy food.  I was told by one of the nurses that there is an executive lounge with coffee, beverages, salads, sandwiches and more!  I have to say I was irritated that I hadn't been informed about the lounge or given a tour upon my arrival.  You would think that the $1100 fee to be in the program would include a tour at least! The lounge was very nice and the concierge was helpful and set me up to have the Mayo Clinic app.  This app is awesome as it allowed me to see all my appointments, fill out the questionnaires ahead of my appointments and even gave me visibility of the doctors notes, results of my labs and more. I highly recommend downloading it! I ended that first day around 2 pm and just as I got back to my hotel, I was contacted about returning for additional tests on an area of concern. They worked me in for a 3:00 which was amazing! The additional testing gave me relief that I did not have anything to worry about. Thank goodness! I went back for my second day a little earlier as now I knew I could relax in the lounge. I then went to my first appointment of the day and continued going to all appointments with ease.  There were a couple appointments scheduled for later dates that I was trying to get in during my 3 day visit so I was told to be a checker. A checker is a person who goes to the department and checks to see if there are any cancellations that would enable you to be checked in to that spot. The catch is you have to wait in the lobby for 3-4 hours. While this process is a little daunting, versus being ultra comfortable in the executive lounge, they are pretty transparent with providing information on the likelihood of you getting in.  After I was told I would not be able to get in, I decided to head over to the healthy living building as I had a late afternoon group session to discuss stress. Once I checked in I was told I could relax in the waiting area.  I inquired about the spa and asked if there were any massage sessions available. Luckily I got in! I went into the spa and was briefly shown the facilities...basically a hot tub and sauna. I asked what I should do as I didn't bring a swimsuit and I was given a disposable bikini. Let me tell you that I am a size 8 and this bikini fit fine although if you are larger than a size 10, I'm not sure it would fit. I then went into the hot tub which was nice but the water wasn't very hot. I went into the steam room next and it was insanely steamy...I literally could not see my hand in front of my face! After getting out of the steam room I took a brief shower and waited for my massage therapist. The 50 minute deep pressure massage was very good although a little uncomfortable at times when he was trying to work out knots, I highly recommend this service! I paid $118 (massage plus tax) and was told I could not leave a tip as it was part of the Mayo Clinic services.  I went to my group class and headed back to the hotel around 6 pm. It was quite a long day! Day 3, today...I headed over at 6:30 am. I went to my appointments and was again met by professional, friendly faces.  I will be heading home shortly and this experience had been phenomenal. The only area for improvement based on my experiences here are communication. Based on my nature of asking questions I was able discover some great things that I otherwise wouldn't have known about since nobody told me. I highly recommend the executive health program and I will be returning next year!"

"44","Jennie D.","Mesa, AZ",1,"My 80 year old father who is hard of hearing and gets confused easily had a staff infection on his arm. I booked an appointment with doctor K. Kimes @ Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale. I was told at the door I was not allowed up with him after we made a long drive there! I was told I would have to wait outside in 100* heat till his appointment was done. They did NOT tell us this while booking. My father has slight dementia and can not remember or comprehend what doctors tell him that's why I always go with him, I am his care taker and bill payer. I was so distraught and upset by this I let my dad go up to get out of the heat but I called up to Dr. Kimes office to ask for an exception that I come up and accompany my dad. The receptionist was rude and said no. I said ""I just want to be clear, you asked Dr. Kimes & she said no?"" And the receptionist hung up on me!!!!!!!!!! Next thing I know I get a call from someone saying that I can come up. I go up and the doctor was SO rude it was unbelievable. I have reached out to the Mayo Clinic multiple times to get back to me regarding this and they have not. For a cash only hospital you sure have no idea how to treat loved ones of patients. We will not be returning to this rude doctor or any other doctor there besides Dr. Masory (if you're smart you will not lose him you are extremely lucky to even have him!!!). I expect an email so I can go into further detail and you can tell me what you have done to fix this issue. 4mycalanderonandroid@gma…PS don't give me any COVID BS either we both had masks and gloves on. And if Mike Pence can walk in without a face mask and an entorage then I should be able to assist my father with an infection, loss of hearing and dementia up to his appointment with masks and gloves."
"45","Robert P.","Hudson, WI",1,"it's amazing that you go there and they want to help, you pay every month and if it's not enough, they take you to a collection agency for a balance of less than $2300.00 been making payments of $100.00 a month on time aways on same day !! be careful it's all about the money !! remember covid ?? you would think they have something better to do!"
"46","Bill S.","Montgomery, MD",1,"This hospital cares about neither patients nor staff.

"48","Cheryl P.","Minneapolis, MN",5,"I have been treated for 2 different cancers in the last 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester and have received excellent & compassionate treatment!  The RN's in oncology are the best!  And my doctors in hematology & in oncology are great!  They are very thorough and treat you as though you are part of their family!  I have a cancer of an unknown origin and cannot believe all the information and research that has been done to get a proper treatment plan.  Everything is explained to me in detail - never a rushed appointment and without their expertise I may not feel as good as I do today!  I have never received better care from any other health facility!  My husband is also receiving care at Mayo and he echos my sentiments!"
"49","Sheryl M.","Honolulu, HI",5,"Mayo Clinic. Gosh, where do I begin? I mean, there's a reason that Mayo Clinic is THE place to be for top notch healthcare. U.S. News and World Report, named Mayo Clinic, as one of America's Best Hospitals for 21 years in a row. Furthermore, stating that, ""Mayo Clinic is a high-quality facility"". So true.Mayo Clinic consists of two towers. The Mayo Building and The Gonda Building. The Mayo Building was originally constructed in 1955 with 10 floors. Fifteen years later, in 1970, 8 more floors were added during the expansion of the clinic. Then, in 2001, the Gonda Building was built adding 21 more floors.It is important to note, that elevators are building and floor(s) specific, so pay close attention to signs. During the busy morning hours, however, there will always be someone between elevators to assist you if needed.In most cases, Mayo Clinic does not require referrals, however, some insurers may require it. Claims must be filed through your own private insurance, and / or be prepared to pay for out of pocket expenses. Medicaid is not accepted. Costly? Yes. Worth it? Yes.Unlike many healthcare institutions across the country, Mayo has state of the art equipment in nearly every department, and prides themselves on research and patient education and treatment.New patients will often be advised to anticipate daily appointments for 7 to 10 days. Keep in mind that the clinic is closed on weekends, and this does not include any follow up visits that may be required thereafter. Most major hotels in Downtown Rochester have shuttle services to and from the clinic, and to the Mayo Clinic Hospital, St. Marys Campus nearby. In addition to the number of shuttles that will take you back to your hotel, there are also shuttles that will take you to Walmart, the Apache Mall, and the local favorite grocery store, HyVee Market.Lastly, all physicians have a fixed salary. Therefore, there is no monetary incentive to see patients in large numbers. The result? Patients have the opportunity to develop a positive rapport with their doctor and are able to comfortably discuss matters without ever feeling rushed."
"50","Blai L.","Inver Grove Heights, MN",1,"If you're early for your appointment at Mayo Clinic they're not going get to you on time. But if you're late for your appointment than you become top priority....Also when they book your appointment for you they split up the hours such as one is at 10am and the next one is 12pm. Which is hard for us non local resident."
"51","Roland K.","Rochester, MN",4,"I saw Dr. Patel for an eye issue. Dr Patel and the staff was very friendly. The process was smooth from beginning to end. There were a lot of people at check in, the checking in  process was smooth but did take a while."
"52","Benjamin K.","Tempe, AZ",1,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!  Neurology department is a joke. Dr. Shin does not take time to listen or get the correct information about his patients before they arrive.  Drove down to establish care with Dr. Shin,  had a extremely important appointment to go over scans and test which are the most important things to me.  He knowingly scheduled my appointment without having that information.  So I basically spent $850 to get no new information or results.   He seemed annoyed when I asked him questions and was not even listing when I asked him some questions on eating or health in general,  just wants to load you with medication.  Total waste of time and money going to the Neurology department they only care about your MONEY not the contact or care they give to patients.  DO NOT RECOMMEND MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER to anyone."
"53","Stefanie S.","Anderson, SC",1,"I went to Mayo last year in May after having some concerning neurological symptoms for a couple of years. I saw Dr. Gavrilova in neurology. Before coming I spent a lot of time collecting all of my medical records from the previous years and typing out a list of my daily symptoms. When meeting with Dr. Gavrilova she was not warm or compassionate and from our discussion she had spent no time looking over my records. She was dismissive of my concerns of abnormal labs I had in the past. She ordered a lot of tests and advised that I make an appointment with the fibromyalgia clinic. She did this before she even had my test results back - I guess assuming I had fibromyalgia. Scheduling was unorganized and we had to request to see her again to get the test results. She ordered an MRI which has just showed up on my bill that I've been paying monthly - 6 months later and was denied by insurance because Mayo did not complete the preauthorization paperwork for the MRI. It was over $4000 added to my bill that I almost had paid off. Mayo is blaming the insurance company and insurance is blaming Mayo.  Because it took Mayo 6 months to add the MRI to my bill I am past the time limit to file an appeal.  At the follow up appointment she explained that the MRI was abnormal but still suggested I go to the fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue clinic instead of trying to figure out what was causing all of this. She also ordered another genetic test and they drew blood for it. I had to pay $1000 out of pocket for it and they let my blood sit there for 2 months before sending it to the lab. I was calling for my results and that's when they realized they never sent it!! When Dr. Gavrilova called with the results I was charged another $500 for the conversation we had about the test results and I really have no answers or the correct diagnosis. I would not recommend Mayo to anyone! I know it's hard but try to find a good doctor that listens to you. I spent thousands to travel to MN from SC and it was a complete waste."
"54","Michelle W.","Rochester, MN",4,"I have two brothers and they have men2a and we go here once a year. I have good experiences here. I just have to wait here really, but the views are very nice, and there are lots of places to wait. Really nice looking place and it serves our family well."
"55","Phillip H.","Las Vegas, NV",5,"Excellent Hospital.  Their customer service and health care is impeccable. It's hard to explain what makes this place so special. I guess you just have to see and feel it in person. They took such great care of my mom and even though I was just there for support they treated me like I was a patient. Over the 8 days we were there we came into contact with about 40 to 50 workers and every single one of them were super nice, helpful and caring. It's simply amazing. Even the people that work around the Hospitals ( Restaurant workers, hotel clerks, Lyft drivers ) all work in sync with Mayo to make your experience as easy as possible. Special shout out to the staff at St Mary's Hospital.  I'll never forget you guys for how you treated and cared for my mother. You guys rock!!!"
"56","Stuart W.","Antioch, IL",1,"I tried to get in when I was 21 years old and diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I was denied. Now at age 31 they accepted me as a patient but didnt mention that I need to put a down payment of 5000 before being seen and to pay all out of pocket before hand. I am poor as it's been a decade of adulthood without work and the most horrible disablillility and they wont take me. What a crock. This place was supposed to be the best in the world and charitable. I filled out the financial forms and they just called me illegible and poor. I have now messed up my life. In anticipation of going to mayo in january 2020 I began to stop my current treatments that mask my symptoms so I could get a complete review at my appointments here and now I'm lost. Mayo ruined my life. I really hoped they could help me. Now I know they are like every other medical facility in america."
"57","Artguy C.","Downtown, Rochester, MN",5,"What can you say about the best hospital in the world?They are simply the Best. The staff treats you like you come first and the doctors are the Best at what they do. My family has had two babies at Mayo clinic (both turned out better than average, by the way). It's sort of a One-Stop medical Mecca. Because of that you probably need to drive there a little bit early because parking is a challenge to say the least, but they planned ahead and gave us a skyway and a Subway to walk through during the cold and hot months, so even if you have to walk a good ways, you're still relatively comfortable doing it. I'm thankful to live as close to Mayo clinic as I do, but even if I move away I'm still coming back here for my medical needs."
"58","Courtney C.","Chicago, IL",5,"My review is for Dr. Ravindra Ganesh, who is truly an amazing doctor. Thank you so much for your care for my case in 2017. Dr. Ganesh is caring, knows what he's talking about, and goes above and beyond. He talked to me like a real person, not just another patient, and turned a difficult time in my life around."
"59","Eric S.","Arizona City, AZ",1,"I was excited about going to Mayo Clinic because of their reputation, but found them to operate like a shady mechanic. I have been to many specialists over the years for my genetic condition but none that string you along like Mayo does. All other surgeons I have ever seen either say the will or won't operate. NOT MAYO. They took it upon themselves to schedule 8 more appointments for me without my permission and I am feeling like they will keep doing that without ever treating the issue I came in for originally. Then when you get your bill expecting one copay you see that they charge an extra office visit for every doctor that assisted the doctor you came to see. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING. VERY FRUSTRATING AND DISAPPOINTING!!"
"60","David F.","Nashville, TN",5,"I am a fit and healthy man with, thankfully, relatively little experience of hospitals. In my experience Royal Darwin (Northern Australia) and Chiang Mai Ram (Thailand) are world class. Darwin's hospital is free (It's in Australia) and Chiang Mai Ram is very inexpensive.Mayo Clinic is expensive, as are most hospitals here in the Land of The...'Free', but it is raised to another level of medical worth.Politics and dollars aside, the Mayo Clinic must be one of the best medical facilities in the USA. The whole place is beautifully constructed and decorated. The level of efficiency from every single person we encountered, in three separate visits, was astounding. There are no long waits, no prevarication, no loose ends. The place, as one would expect from a hospital, is very clean, and that translates to a reduced risk of infection.My girl needed an operation and we chose Mayo after careful research. She is progressing well and we attribute that, in no small part, to the staff at Mayo.It is my opinion that if you want to feel justifiably confident in the medical team looking after you in this country, you need to make your way to Mayo Clinic.It is, without doubt, a superior facility."
"61","Cheryl M.","Casselberry, FL",1,"Went to the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville for severe nerve pain in thoracic (middle) of my back.  suffering with this pain for 2 years and could not find drs locally that could help.  after several fail attempts with local drs and with pain management procedures, my pain management dr referred me to mayo clinic.  I had such high hopes only to be disappointed once again by lack of care to the point of the neuro surgeon telling me he could not figure out what to do based on the films(mri, CT, xrays etc) and he would bring my file to his peers(other neuro surgeons pain management doctors) and call me on a tuesday that call never came.  I contacted the office 2 days later and claimed he never went to the meeting.  He then called me 4 days later to say no one had any ideas.  I don't trust he ever discussed my case with anyone.  Aren't they know for difficult cases? Even knowing the desperation I was feeling as it was written all over my face .  Mayo in Jacksonville only cares about money.  I had to put 5k up front just to be seen.  only to have to fight for it back after my insurance paid them like they said they would!  They are pathetic!"
"62","Meagan J.","Denver, CO",1,"I saw one of the most condescending doctors I've ever experienced (Lisa Drage), and she was completely wrong with my diagnosis. I traveled out of state to see her in Rochester at the Mayo Clinic, which was a pretty penny as I had no insurance for out of state. But my health was top priority and I wasn't finding anyone local who could assess what was going on, so I felt as though this would be worth it. I had a horrible rash all over my face and on my lower extremities. She scolded me for using what she considered too many products on my face and blamed me for my horrible rash. She provided nothing but more emotional trauma. Finally, 3 years later I've found a doctor who has nailed everything and boy oh boy was Lisa Drage WRONG. Drage quickly diagnosed my face rash as perioral dermatitis from too many products and my lower extremities as a herpes outbreak. Even though all of my cultures and biopsies had already screened for herpes. Come to find out I have rosacea fulminans or pyoderma faciale on my face (she may need to google all of these as I'm sure she's never heard of any of this before), pyoderma gangrenosum on my lower extremities, and come to find out these are related to IBD - which my current doctor had me screened for and I do have. All of these things were related and Drage was 100% wrong about everything."
"63","N S.","Honolulu, HI",3,"The Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN SHOULD be the best in the world, but is actually RUN-OF-THE MILL.  MD judgement is replaced by a robotic system set to increase reimbursement ($) and reduce physician control. This ""efficiency"" makes patient care mediocre. One specialist MD cannot refer directly to another. The system is always in the way.Go to the pharmacy and the prescriptions ready are only from that last specialist - not the meds for your procedure next day, the ones you were messaged to pick up.  No matter that you asked the clerk, ""please, are you sure this is all?"" Medical history is garbled into an inaccurate composite that would have the original Mayo brothers ENRAGED or IN TEARS, or both, if they had to deal with this system. Ever play the game,""telephone""? First kid whispers a word into second kid's ear, and so on down the line. Last kid says the word heard out loud. Play with more than 2 kids, the starting word is never the word spoken out at the end. At Mayo this game is applied to patient care.The patient speaks to a ""cheaper"" clinician (say LPN), what the patient said is Passed to the RN, who then speaks to the Surgeon, the Surgeon passes his or her conclusion back to the RN - who finally informs the patient. Confusion and error result. Everything else is communicated on line on the ""patient portal"" which does not appear to be scrutinized by anyone OTHER than the patient. Put your info in, but no clerk ever seems to have it. Get your instructions, but ""no reply"" allowed. This leads to surgeons believing a patient is wheelchair bound who simply was wheeled across campus by a younger relative and in fact NEVER uses a wheel chair at home, and a whole variety of other mis-impression's that might be terribly funny in a sit-com but are truly terrible when they impact on what should be excellent care. Be CAREFUL! We can only hope that the docs themselves care enough to save this great institution before it is entirely disabled.addendum: I just read another review and the reply. This verifies my impression as a patient who is also a retired physician and surgeon, note that a neurosurgical patient who is unhappy because he had a bad result gets a reply from THE BUSINESS MANAGER. SHAME on YOU Mayo Clinic, SHAME on perverting the mission of the original Mayo Brother' practice centered on BEST CARE into an organization of accountants."
"64","Debbie F.","Waukee, IA",5,"Without a doubt, this is the standard that all health care should be held to.  My mother's health has been failing over the last 3-4 years and we have been from specialist to specialist all over the state of Iowa with no answers or solutions.  As she kept deteriorating, we spoke with her G.P. who did a referral letter to Mayo.The first week we visited, we got more results than the last few years of being shuffled from doctor to doctor.  Mom was checked from the top of her head to the pads of her feet and they found issues we never imagined to exist.Now three months later we are back for our third visit and she is thriving.  We owe so much to the efficency and caring of the Mayo Clinic and their staff.The primary reason I am awed by them is their communication.  The patient app for a smart phone is incredible.  Now, we have instant access to Mom's records, regardless of where we are.  At home, when I request her medical records, it can take several weeks to get copies.  And best of all...the doctors all communicate with each other here.When she has lab work done in the morning here, the doctor has the results by the time we see him in the afternoon.  Our experiences at home have been hounding the lab to get results to a doc by the next week.From the volunteers in the lobbies to the doctors, the staff has all been incredible.  There is a sense of real paitent care here.Aestically solution it is a beautiful place to heal.  The art collections, the music from the grand piano in the subway, and relaxing areas to wait all lend to a calming spirit.I am convinced this is the place to be when trying to find solutions.  My family owes a great debt to Mayo Clinic."

I stopped trying. Other parts work fine.  Third, I got a call that I needed a covid test.  Mayo was not available during the weekend except in a town over an hour away and that was only 1/2 day on Saturday.  this surprised me as Mayo is always sending me their self-aggrandizing ads about how much they care and what they are doing to deal with the pandemic..."
"67","John M.","Dubuque, IA",5,"I'm almost reluctant to offer this review, because it's going to be so over the top that maybe your experience can't possibly live up to it. Let's take the risk.Went in today for my first appointment since moving to Rochester. Nothing major, just some foot pain. I'm a white male Medicaid patient, early 60's. The nurse recorded weight and height, checked blood pressure, and filled in some blanks in my medical records. Then the doctor examined my feet and did a basic intake exam: heart and lungs, check for skin cancer, talk about medical and family history, etc. She decided to schedule some blood tests and X-rays of my feet. Those took place immediately on leaving her office: the appointment was at 8:30, and I was done with exam, blood tests, and X-rays by 10 AM. It felt unrushed and efficient.It's now 1:30 PM of the same day. They sent the results of the blood tests, and a note by the doctor about those and the X-rays. (Oh, and she set up a physical therapy appointment before I left, too.)Everyone I met was charming and professional, from the clerks who checked me in to those who checked me out as I left. Did I mention I'm a Medicaid patient?I wish everyone in our country could have the quick, professional, pleasant care I received today, and take it for granted as a given."
"68","Shelly J.","Rochester, MN",2,"You're just another number at Mayo Clinic and it is very politically and egotistically driven to the point where I would go as far as some people there play God. They waste their money on a lot of things they don't need to. Very prejudice towards certain staff in ways that I cannot explain on yelp. They are behind the eight ball as well in terms of change and research driven or evidence-based practice. This is a safe place to receive care however just know that they have a long ways to go to be #1. I would recommend going elsewhere if you really want to get to know your doctors due to constant turnover with residents."

The building is beautiful, clean and friendly people everywhere helping you out.  The check in was quick and easy - and receptionist was kind and payed attention to detail while protecting patient information.My appointment was at 3:15 and I was taken back at 2:51.  They are prompt and there was minimal wait time!  The ophthalmology staff was courteous and very thorough.  I was impressed by the examination each person involved performed.Treatment rooms are clean and spacious.  Dr. Holmes is a genius.  My sister and I were so impressed with him and his ability to problem solve.

"70","Kirby S.","Oceanside, CA",1,"Came in through the ER after a botched Mayo procedure at their own hospital to dilate my esophagus tore a hole in it. Stayed 3 days and was never offered personal hygiene. Two hours before I was discharged  I asked for a toothbrush and that was the extent that was provided. A previous stay was identical, completely disheartening at the lack of care and concerns for my fellow patients. There were great nurses but absolutely a minority.If that was the only example I could get over it but I have so many documented examples of wrong medication doses, incorrect symptoms reported, and absolute false statements in medical records. I was told to take antidepressants but my symptoms were actually anemia which was easily corrected with iron supplements. They search for key words in your description of symptoms and assign it to the first drug that fits.Because of their reputation I didn't want to complain hoping to ignore all these mistakes and get a good treatment plan. These incidents occurred over the last year and luckily I'm taking NO medications and couldn't be better.I was humiliated, disrespected and belittled. I'm lucky I'm able to afford going to HonorHealth and receive much better patient care with compassion."
"71","Shan Z.","Rochester, MN",5,"Mayo consistently is ranked the top hospital in the country, and for good reason. The facilities here are phenomenal. The staff is knowledgeable, and there are volunteers throughout the hospital to answer any questions you may have. Parking is easily accessible through garages and underground tunnels. Tips from a local: there are tons of restaurants in the tunnels (called subways) under the hospitals. I highly recommend eating lunch or a snack at Daubes or taking the skywalk to Zzzest Lunch Counter. Ask a volunteer how to get to each. Also, plan to eat somewhere else for dinner. Everything in the subways shuts down at 5pm and on the weekends. There is original artwork thought the buildings. Roadans and Ellsworth Kellys, just to name a few of the high profile artists you will see.  There is so much that the hospital even has an official tour you can take. To access the tour, go to the Judd Auditorium at 1:00 M-F in the Mayo building. Make sure you are on time, they will leave without you!"

I had a serious pain flare (a multiple times a day occurrence) where my face turned ashen gray and I couldn't sit or stand. My mum took me to the Mayo ER. They gave me Percocet and dilaudid, and I fell asleep. My mum stepped out of the room for a phone call with my dad and they wheeled me off to the psych ward. They wouldn't tell my mum where I was. My dads a lawyer so he had to call with POA, luckily already something we had done. Then they made it extremely hard for them to get me out. My dad had to get ahold of a board member. The entire time I was crying in a psych ward room and they told me my parents didn't want me and weren't going to get me. I was there for hours under this guise, and they took my clothes and belongings. This was the most traumatic experience of my life, and I do not support the Mayo Clinic. Do not go here."
"73","Emma H.","Cedar Rapids, IA",5,"First time at the Mayo Clinic. Parking and getting in and where I needed to be was surprisingly easy, considering the size and traffic. Help desk was very friendly and pointed me exactly where to go. I was a tad nervous to be seeing a renowned specialist, but my doctor was very down to earth and confident in the information he gave me. The confidence in his answers makes me feel more reassured about my care and treatment plan. Definitely recommend someone goes there if possible, even just for a second opinion. We stayed in an Airbnb for the week, which helped greatly with traveling cost!"
"74","Susannah H.","Minneapolis, MN",5,"I credit the Mayo Clinic with saving my life, my mother's life, and my father's life, as well as being one of the greatest medical specialist facilities I have ever had the privilege to be able to go to. I don't mind the drive out there so much, and even though Rochester isn't quite a *happening city*, it's charming in its own way. The doctors I have seen there are thorough, patient, incredibly knowledgeable, and very professional. No ""suspender doctors"" here, if you know what I mean. The nurses are also very kind and helpful, the facilities are well maintained (could maybe use a remodel), and it's super easy to get from one appointment to the next. Plus it's SUPER helpful that pretty much every kind of specialist is at Mayo. Need to see a neurologist? No problem!  Podiatrist?  Got it!  ENT specialist?  Child's play! They also have a ton of educational resources, amazing artwork, and shops that can supply pretty much any major medical need. If you can, go to Mayo."
"75","Jenni K.","Rochester, MN",5,"What I really like:1) When you take your kids for their annual exam & immunizations, they give out an informational booklet based on your child's age that provides helpful info on their development as well as suggestions on what parents can do to help nurture and grow their potential.2) The Mayo Clinic puts out lots of free informational booklets & DVDS on a variety of health topics for anyone to explore. For example, I picked up a free DVD on Tai Chi."
"76","Sandy S.","Monticello, MN",5,"Brought my son here after he was diagnosed with neuro issues. Nations #1 neurosurgeons. Modern, classy and impressive, the Mayo Clinic is an impressive marble building. A grand piano is played in the lobby, many, many volunteers to help guide you throughout and even help at the elevators.  This place is huge and a tunnel of mazes called the Subway. The Subway connects the Charlton, Eisenberg, Mayo, Methodist Hospital, many restaurants, shops, drugstores, pharmacies, flower shop, clothing, food court, etc...it's nice when you're here in the winter. No need for a coat. If you stay at one of the connected hotels, you can get to all by this way.The doctors, nurses and volunteers are top notch. We've never felt like a number. We've been treated with the upmost respect. We have had the best oversee our son's treatment. We wouldn't have taken him anywhere else."
"77","J G.","Avondale, AZ",1,"Disgusted because the clinic allowed a politician to ignore their safety protocol. Then they deleted their Tweet which said Pence was previously informed about the rules. Hospitals are supposed to care about patient safety, not pandering to a political agenda."
"78","MJ S.","Nevada / Lidgerwood, Spokane, WA",3,"Very mixed feelings. They provide great service when they can, but if you're looking for doctors who take risk with unusual cases this is NOT the place. I offered to pay them to look at my case before flying across the country, and they said they couldn't make a judgment without seeing me even though I sent all MRIs and records. Yet, within 2 minutes of the appointment they said there was nothing they could do. I knew I shouldn't have gone when they wouldn't give me an advanced answer - because they want the business. I guess you live and learn, but they give excellent business to problems with straight forward solutions! Thanks Mayo"
"79","Donna H.","Champaign, IL",5,"Dr. Sandhya Pruthi , at Mayo Clinic,  Rochester, is the most outstanding doctor I have  ever been to.Smart, gracious, caring, thoughtful, explains everything.She is simply outstanding.    Her department is Breast Imagery.   You will find no one like her.Mayo is the best.   Everyone is so kind, competent  and efficient but Dr. Pruthi is the best !!'"
"80","Shari P.","Anchorage, AK",5,"I was very pleased with my visit to the Mayo Clinic campus in Minnesota.  They had wheelchairs and guest service agents available to assist you.  Many of the hotels offer a free shuttle to the clinic, so I paid $15 to get to the clinic from the airport, and jumped on the free shuttle to the hotel. The clinic also has a free shuttle to Walmart and the Apache Mall. Just another way to get around the city for cheap.  The shuttles stop at 6:30pm. They have a many buildings within the clinic.  The buildings change name with directions.  So, you can be on the 19th floor and the North could be the Mayo buildings, and South could be the Gonda Building.  It's very easy to get confused, but they have helpful staff everywhere! When I was given my original itinerary, they had me scheduled through August, but I kept checking everyday for cancelations, and was able to fit all of my test within two weeks. That made me very happy. They do process a lot of people, and it can sometimes feel like you're being rushed, but for the most part, I felt I was treated well. I liked how I was able to check in early to procedures, and get processed early.  Didn't work out all the time, but I can admit they were never late.  This shows how efficient they are. The location has a cafeteria, but it closes at 2pm, which was a little early for me, but there are plenty of restaurants in the vicinity. There are shops in the vicinity for people who are waiting for long periods of time. I really appreciated all of the art in the location, which made it seem less intimidating. The media used wad very diversed."
"81","Marge S.","Winchester, OR",1,"In October of 2019 my best friend was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She and her husband spent several days researching the best possible hospital. After research, and talking to medical professionals they selected the Mayo Clinic in Rochester MN. We live in Oregon so this meant a lot of travel, but they wanted the best team. Their first visit with the Oncologist and surgeon went very well. They returned home for her to begin a very aggressive regime of chemo. Covid 19 hit so she had to have an extra round of chemo to get her follow up appointment scheduled. They risked Covid exposure to fly back to Rochester for their appointments. She was to get a scan on one day, and the next day see the Oncologist and surgeon. The next day, upon meeting with the Oncologist, she was informed her appointment with the surgeon had been cancelled. She had had no notification of this change. The reason they gave was because of Covid 19. The hospital did not know what the availability of respirators would be if she could have surgery following radiation. I guess surgery for pancreatic cancer is elective surgery. You elect surgery or you die. She had several questions that the Oncologist couldn't answer but said the surgeon would call her and let her know what the plan would be moving forward. She told the Oncologist she would return to her room and wait for his call. He did not call, so she called his office the next day and was told he was given the message and would call her. To this day the surgeon has never reached out. My friend and her husband returned from the trip devastated. She now had no team, and no plan. Fortunately OHSU and our local cancer center stepped up and took over. She has completed aggressive radiation and now waits to see if she will be able to have life saving surgery. My huge problem in all of this is the total lack of communication and follow through by a medical institution that is reportedly so good. How any doctor can lack so much empathy is beyond me. I feel these actions are, if not malpractice, unethical. Shame all everyone at Mayo involved in this, from the nurse who never notified her about the cancellation, before making the long dangerous trip, to the Oncologist, who was unable answer any of her questions, and finally to the unfeeling surgeon who totally dropped the ball."
"82","Cynthia E.","Hopkins, MN",5,"I love Minnesota to death and what makes it even unique is having Mayo, as cheesy as it sounds it's a fact! I live in Minneapolis, and down here we have pretty legit hospitals. The ones I always went to were and actually still go are,  HCMC, Fairview Southdale Hospital and of course Park Niccolet. I am very thankful for my health, so far so good the only major issue I had was I split my face open, and Fairview gave me stitches. I married and my partner he started to develop Keratoconus which thins and scars your cornea which causes vision loss. He has this disease on both of his eyes and the feeling of your other half losing his vision rapidly, and you can not reverse this disease is beyond me, it's the most painful, heartbreaking, hopeless feeling seeing the person you love going through something that is out of your control. We went to every hospital and vision specialist here in the Twin Cities, we even tried the U of M and everyone said that Keratoconus is rare that they do not have much to work with, and also if they could help out the cost would be out of the top ridiculous amount of money. This went on for a month, till one-day driving I remember "" WAIT A F***ING MINUTE, WE HAVE MAYO."" Well, that same day I hit up Mayo and guess what? They do work Keratoconus patients, and they have the proper tools to help slow the disease down and cornea transplants if need be.! The condition never goes away, but they can slow it down.!!!Guess what else! They work with you on payments! WHAT!!!!! Payment plans!!! WTF. Whatever you can afford to pay monthly they work with you! MIND BLOWING! Never had issues with our insurance! At first, when I thought about Mayo, I was super excited, but I was terrified about cost thinking such a fancy top notch hospital this is going to be pricey but worth it! But Mayo cares about your health then forcing a payment out of you. Every time we came in for a checkup our Doctor Mr. Patel ( AMAZING ) always would ask us if our insurance company is giving us a hard time and if so he will help with the situation. Never had a doctor ask me if I need help financially or if my insurance company was being a pain in the a**.Long story short Mayo is the place to go to, yes it is in Rochester it's about a 2-hour drive, and we go every 2 weeks but now with his Keratoconus being stable and his vision is better than before now its every 2 months, its well worth it. If your worried about cost, don't be Mayo has payment plans whatever you can put down they accept it. They just ask questions, how much you make, family members, your current situation, and that's basically kinda it. We didn't have to provide proof just our honest word, insurance we have not had an issue with it, but hearing our doctor ask if they're being a pain and that they can help with that is pretty assuring that they will help out. I'm not being dramatic when I say if I never thought about Mayo I honestly believe, he would have lost his vision by now, no one helped out all they would do is eye scans, no treatment not even eye drops!! But the first day of Mayo was a long one, scans, test, but at the end, we came out with a treatment plan, medications and a future plan on what the next couple months will look like, which is nice to know beforehand. Aside from that, the building is SOOOO massive not even funny very organized, super clean, doesn't even feel like a hospital which I like because hospitals make me a little uneasy, but this has more of a museum, business, sleek, modern feel that I swear you would doublethink "" Is this Mayo? Or a Science Museum?"" They have food courts, shops, tours, music, skyways, hotels it's super nice! But massive so you can get lost, but there's maps and helpful staff all around just in case you end up like me standing there looking dumb. One more thing which I thought was dope is the doctors have no uniform they dress in business suits. I kid you not when our doctor came in which was actually 2 doctors the first visit they walked in with fitted business suits they looked like Calvin Klein models, no joke I thought there were like FBI or CEO. ,I thought that was pretty cool, the nurses they have the regular uniforms but the Doctors they look like eye candy  . don't mind that!. But in all seriousness, Mayo is the best hospital, I recommend going here before any other hospitals, to save you some stress."
"83","Emma ..","Traverse City, MI",5,"Everyone there is extremely professional! I see now why it's the top place to go for medical care- mental or physical.Building is easy to navigate, it's also connected to a hotel you can stay at. There's a cafeteria, too. Doctors are all very nice and give amazing advice."
"84","Steven J.","Santa Fe, NM",1,"A completely worthless American corporation!This ""hospital"" refuses to see patients with complex medical issues even if they have full insurance and a doctor referral!  While the initial phone number you call has a caring person on the other end, they simply send 98% of people an email denial form letter within 1-2 days.I suggest you look elsewhere unless you...A) live by one of their clinics orB) have a very obvious condition that they can diagnose easily.This once famed institution has greatly fallen and is no better than your local urgent care in your neighborhood.Shame of you Mayo!  Your lack of compassion to treat people, especially those who have full insurance, is shocking and horrific.  I see more and more reviews like this as the months go by, and it leads me to think that you are becoming nothing more than a greedy American corporation with no heart or concern for people with real issues.  I doubt I'll get any response to my concern, but I'm willing to be proven wrong and even change my review if someone with actual decision power would contact me.  I can be very reasonable, but it is hard to be that way with an entity that so far has been exceedingly unreasonable.All the best to those who need help and cannot seem to find it!"
"85","Julia F.","Los Angeles, CA",5,"Mayo Clinic is beautiful. There's a reason why people come here from all over the world. First of all- the Doctors are all lovely. It was such a relief to meet with doctors who didn't have to google my condition. I was treated with respect, and taken seriously. For the most part, all of my doctors were on time. However, I did have to wait one hour to see a specialist. Which is fine, things happen, but thank goodness for the free wifi! I forgot my book and without the wifi, I would've been bored. The Mayo Clinic campus itself is HUGE!!! There is free wifi throughout the whole campus. If you still play Pokémon Go, there's a lot of Pokémon around to catch (no shame). I tried to arrive about an hour early each day, for parking, and walking to the main building. It still gave me about 30 minutes to spare, and I'd go grab a quick cup of coffee. It was so nice meeting with medical professions who didn't have to look up my condition! If you get referred here, and your insurance covered your visit/you're filthy rich... GO HERE! Seriously the best medical care."

"88","Linda R.","San Francisco, CA",2,"We are anxious to do a complete evaluation directly to Mayo but haven't seen that yet. We dealt with a downed computer system (which I don't even blame them for that), but how they handled themselves- from the desk staff, to the intake nurse to the doctors on how they dealt with it was difficult. We were offered few options & were told in the end the one procedure that would offer @ least temporary relief wasn't available for over a month. We drove over 14 hrs round trip and were willing to be there as long as it took. We were dismissed after 2 appointments in one day only to be called after we made the long drive home that they could do the procedure tomorrow.Beyond belief disappointed in this ""medical Mecca """
"89","Koko C.","Grand Rapids, MI",1,"Mayo's business manager does not deny cherry picking cases/patients when he defends it with demand exceeds supply arguments. Cancer & chemo get top priority, bc there's big money in chemo and surgery. Their TV ads are about cancer. You can get around their cherry picking if you just show up without an appt, as a ""checker"". Could be either a long wait, or faster than waiting for an appt - if you happen to be gifted with an appt. There are lots of better places to get quality care, so keep looking."

Everything is efficient, clean and modern, and of the doctors are all great. We flew here specifically for care and it was worth it. Schedule an appointment online and you'll immediately see why they are the best -- they called us the next day and talked to us for 2 hrs and got us squared away with an appointment, transportation, hotels, etc."

"93","Heidi D.","Omaha, NE",2,"My boyfriend and I went up to Rochester for a second opinion with the Mayo Clinic, his appointment was on May 23, 2016. He has been battling Chronic Pancreatitis. We were aware that there is not much treatment for Chronic Pancreatitis and we were not expecting miracles. When we went to the appointment he was first seen by Lisa D. Pisney, ANP in the Gastroenterology, she looked through his history and asked questions, she stated the same things that he should be doing like don't drink, don't smoke and eat a low fat diet. She stated that there wasn't much they can really do at this point but said that she will see what the doctor had to say. We then saw Dr. Randall Pearson who wanted to do a high contrast CT because one hasn't been done in a while. He told us we will get the CT completed and follow back up with him to discuss the results and possible treatment. He was scheduled for his scan the following day.His CT scan was that following day which was relatively quick, however, no follow up appointment was given and we were sent back to our hotel wondering ""what's next?"" We did not hear anything for the rest of that day and we ended up calling Dr. Pearson's secretary the next day to find out what we should do. She told us that she would have Nurse Pisney contact us which sadly never happened. We ended up leaving a day early after not hearing from the Mayo Clinic for 48 hours since his scan, I am glad we did because they never did call him, we could have left two days earlier actually so we feel our time was wasted. We are just going to ask them to send his CT results to his doctor at home. Overall, we expected better and are highly disappointed in how we were treated. We felt blown off. The campus was beautiful and well maintained, shuttle service to/from the hotels is convenient. In the end though that is just colored bubbles. We were not there for the scenery but the treatment and sadly felt like we wasted our time."
"94","Jo M.","Rochester, NY",1,"I am changing my review. At first I was so impressed by them, but they aren't good at all for small fiber neuropathy or complex situations. They put people in their diagnostic flow chart and if you don't fall into a neat basket they say you have Central Sensitization...and while I believe there is truth to bodies becoming sensitized to pain, that is not a cause of illness. It is a result of illness. And, pain was not among my chief symptoms. When my blood labs failed to shown improvement after taking the prescribed supplement, rather than investigate why, I was accused of not taking the supplement and shut out by the physician in charge of my care. He wouldn't even return my calls or see me after I traveled across country to my other appointments there. A year and a half later, I continue to take the supplement and am given it intravenously and my bloodwork still hasn't shown an improvement. I went to their patient relations office to try to get to see the physician again and it was nothing more than an attempt to avoid lawsuits. They are not patient advocates working there, they are Mayo employees. They gave up on me and I am giving up on them."

"96","Claudia T.","Asheville, NC",1,"First off, I think the doctors care and this hospital has a history of doctors doing research Andy treatments helping people globally. This is about the hospital though and the issues with the financial department... Returning from a trip to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. My endocrinologist got paperwork saying I was approved by NM medicaid for treatment and surgery for my adrenal tumors and Cushing's syndrome. I made an apt on the phone with a rep from endocrinology who said insurance and everything was good and ready. I then received a call before my appointment (after flying to Rochester) that Mayo didn't work with Medicaid and they would not accept my insurance. Many calls later between doctors and insurance and Mayo the business office at Mayo Clinic called and said to proceed with the consultation. That was yesterday. I asked ""I'm not going to get a bill right? I can't afford this"" and they said no.... today they (Amber and bed supervisor in the business office)said they never said that (they absolutely did and I would NOT have accepted a consult if I had known they'd mess up getting me here then bill me for it) and it would be $675 (just for a 30 min consult I didn't want or need, no tests, no answers, no treatment). So after flight expenses for my mom and myself, hotels, time off work, and a bill I was implied was for a free consult, no surgery, no treatment, nothing but a hospital that prides itself on ""inclusivity"" and ""diversity"" as long as you're rich."
"97","Jim L.","Farmington, MN",5,"If you want to see how a well-oiled machine works, this is the place.  They set up a timed schedule throughout the day so you know where you will be and when each day.  If one thing runs long then your entire schedule for the day is modified to get the most out of each and every day.  The professionalism and organization of this place is top-notch and it feels good not to be involved with a so-so environment when you are battling for your life.  Everyone that I talk to about this place just talks so highly about it.  If you are having a cancer scare, I think this is the best place for you to be to maximize your chances of a full recovery.  That is all they do and they do it well."
"98","Aaron J.","Los Angeles, CA",2,"Looks like most others did way better than I did here.  I flew across the country and spent a week at Mayo. I went to Mayo to have my chronic pain diagnosed. I'm barely hanging on by a thread. While everyone was very nice and professional (thus the two stars), I didn't leave with a cure, diagnosis or treatment. Their best advice?  That I attend their 2-3 week chronic pain program, where they basically teach you to ""accept your pain.""  I've emailed them several times since, and when they don't want to talk with you anymore, they ""end"" the email thread leaving you unable to respond. Yeah, the place looks super fancy and all of that.... but that is where it ends. I don't feel that they care ABOUT me nor do they care what happens TO me. I'm mostly upset with myself... for clearly doing a terrible job of communicating to the Mayo folks of how horrifying, crippling and disabling my chronic pain is. The fact is, they don't care.  And as of now, neither do I.Also, why can't opiates or benzodiazepines be considered as part of the regimen for chronic pain sufferers once a patient has been to every single type of doctor that exists, and once they've tried every other non-narcotic medication on the market?  Like, once someone has bottomed out and has nothing else to give, and when quality of life has reached absolute zero, why can't there be an honest and frank discussion about the risks and benefits of narcotics?For the life of me (ironically), I can't figure out why doctors appear to be perfectly fine with chronic pain sufferers ending up dead. How much pain and suffering can a single individual endure?  When did we, as a society, decide to lose all compassion for those suffering 24/7??  Fentanyl patches, for example, would be an incredible way for those dealing with intractable pain. Such medication is produced for pennies in massive amounts on an annual basis.  But, I guess I can't have any of this medication nor anything else that might allow me to live.... with any small degree of relief.The attitude of all doctors these days is.... sorry... can't help you.... best of luck. I'm hoping my story serves a purpose for others some day. It'll be too late for me.  But, I'm hoping my story, which Mayo is fully aware of... wakes people up and helps to change policies some day. It doesn't have to be this way - and yet, it does.  G_d Bless."

You, or someone you care about is ill, you may be use to the routine of see the doctor go schedule tests wait wait wait. At Mayo it's the superstore of medicine with the feeling of having found people that actually care. It is so not surly clerks and unpleasant waiting rooms. Everyone we met knew their job and seems genuinely interested in helping. Not irritated that you were interrupting their day, but that they were delighted you stopped by. The doctors actually spend time with you trying to understand what's going on and then explaining it to you. Yeah Rochester is a long way from almost anywhere, but I can't imagine going any place else if I were seriously ill. The facilities are amazing, they are clean, well thought out and modern. It is huge so expect to allow a little lost time,but down load their app as it guides you through. Or just ask anyone as everyone seems happy to help. So I'm really big on this place. I don't work there but I really do recommend it. Highly."
"105","Jennifer L.","Clearwater, FL",5,"Amazing. Beautiful. This place is truly amazing. HANDS DOWN. They really have their act together.I accompanied a family member here and we were both just in awe of the efficiency and coordination of how Mayo works. She met with her lead doctor, who then setup a series of other tests. She was handed a booklet with all the times/dates of her appointments, along with the locations (building, floor, etc) &  instructions for each test. Oh! There's an APP, too! (For you smart phone users). Which shows your doctors, tests, maps of the buildings, etc..In addition, sometimes the appointments are not available at the most convenient of times. For example, one of the appointments is over a week out. We'd only planned to be here for a couple of days. So what you can do is become a ""checker"" -  it's kind of like flying on standby. You go early, check-in and let them know which test you're waiting for, and then if they get an open time during the day when they can take you,  they page you (on the pager you're provided with upon check in). How awesome is that?!? While you're waiting for your tests, there's a variety of areas. We were able to score the most comfortable leather chairs, and ottomans, and some side tables. There's also outlets all over to charge your electronics. And of course, they have free wifi. Although, I did get bumped off a couple of times... I guess I can't complain, since A) they have it, and B) it's free. The place is HUGE. There are also multiple buildings. But the really cool thing is they have this basement called the ""subway"", which connects the buildings and there's a bunch of shops, and pharmacies and fast-food restaurants, etc... There are Information desks all over the place, so if you get lost or need help, there's always someone close by who can give you direction. There's plenty of wheelchairs, and even people to push you around if need be. Many of the local hotels also have shuttles (some shared, some individual), to take you to and fro. I was quite surprised to step out of the elevator into the ""subway"" and found an orchestra playing!! It was beautiful, and there was quite the crowd gathered to watch. Another day, there was someone playing the most beautiful music on a piano that sits in the area. It's just a nice way to take your mind off things - when you suddenly come across beautiful music. The building itself is downright gorgeous. All windows, and made out of granite and marble and everything is sparkly clean. There's also beautiful things to see all over: random fountains, artwork, and statues. Beautiful. Just beautiful. Everyone here is really helpful and kind. If you've got some time to kill between appointments or whatever, there's also plenty to do in the immediate area: Starbucks, shopping, great restaurants - all within walking distance! Not to mention many hotels nearby! I can't say enough about this place. I see now why it's one of the most amazing clinics in the world. There were people here from all over the world, with all kinds of crazy medical problems. The doctors here really know what they're doing."

I just need to read the results of my electrocardiogram to released that.What is outrageous is that your institution knows that Pulmonary Hypertension is not cure, and even your Drs knowing that is being caused by Mitral Valve regurgitation(leaking of the mitral valve that allows backward flow of blood into the left atrium) and a repair or replacement of the valve can reverse my initial or even reverse my pulmonary hypertension they decide to totally ignore.If is any chance to prevent a progression of a pulmonary hypertension that is mild now and totally reversible at your Drs hands I know already that I just will die, any retarded know  mild increase in cardiac filling pressures is the cause. My concern besides survive of course is not the size of the problem, mild or advantage, but the reason that my hypertension could be cured.Nothing will be never done until I have a heart failure and don't need to be a genius to know that even at this point I get the surgery done and be a success my pulmonary hypertension will kill me anyway, for being to late address.How you call yourselves the first hospital in the Country when something like that is happening?Leticia Whaley"
"107","Daniel D.","Grand Forks, ND",1,"My local Doctor referred me to Mayo in Rochester. I got aa call from Mayo asking me all kinds of questions about what was wrong.  a few weeks later I got a letter stating they had people with worse problems than mine and wont be able to see me.  1 year later my local Doctors can't figure out what's wrong.  I'm very unhappy when I see the new commercial they have out stating ""when you need answers, you know where to go""."
"108","Glenn W.","Vermont, IL",5,"If I could, I would give The Mayo Clinic 10 stars. Dr. Sarr was wonderful to my mother. A local oncologist gave my mom 6 months to 1 year to live with her colon cancer. I said we're going to Mayo's she lived 12 years and cancer didn't take her life. The same with my dad, not cancer but dementia issues. Then with myself after a missed diagnosis of a blood clot locally. I am so grateful for this wonderful medical facility and the the people who staff it. God Bless Them All!"
"109","Michelle A.","NC, NC",2,"I've seen multiple great reviews, but I haven't experienced this. Generally, I find that doctors pay attention to those patients that have a diagnosed critical condition. If you're undiagnosed, and they can't determine the issue, you get shuffled from one place to another with nobody actually caring about helping you get well. Many of the doctors I encountered were not great about listening to me, the patient, and that makes for more difficult appointments. I'd recommend them for something diagnosed and serious/critical, but otherwise, you are likely better off elsewhere."
"110","Jennifer M.","Palatine, IL",2,"Very disappointed with Mayo Clinic. My husband desperately needs answers and help. I feel he was treated as an ID number and not a real human being who is suffering. Mayo won't give him the chance to be seen by their Doctors. Three generations of my family have been helped by Mayo but now, I do not feel anyone at Mayo is really listening or cares. Very disheartening."
"111","M M.","San Francisco, CA",3,"Overall my experience at the Mayo Clinic gave me more answers, and pushed me in the correct direction of diagnosis, but it was not without some hiccups.Pros:1. The facilities are fantastic2. The staff are incredibly kind and nice3. After an initial visit, they schedule everything for you within the next 1-2 weeks, which helps get you out of there sooner and not have to spend a fortune on hotels4. They are responsive to any problems that come up and reasonable5. The office staff are very good about relaying messages between you and your doctor and quick at getting back to you.5. Their billing center is very thorough and are excellent at their jobs6. The doctors go out of their way to write any letters needed (ex: I needed letters for flight issues and my insurance that my doc quickly and kindly wrote for me)7. They have the newest technologyCons and Tips for Patients:1. Although having them schedule everything for you makes your life easier, you have to stay on top of things to check for any errors. One of the tests I did, ended up being invalid because they placed me on a certain diet for another test, that influenced the results of the 2nd test. I still had to pay for both tests, and ended up having to redo the 2nd test, which I was not happy about because I had to swallow radiation for it, and spend another week at the hospital, which meant another week of paying for a hotel.2. The person in the lab center gave me the wrong directions for a test. I knew it could not be right, and asked her to check and she brushed me off. I did the test and it came back negative. I checked with my doctor if she had given me the correct directions, and it was confirmed that I was correct, she did not. I ended up having to redo the test out of state, and ship my samples to Minnesota. This set me back months in my treatment, and was a huge headache and inconvenience. Sure enough my 2nd results came back positive. Had I not advocated for myself I would have never gotten the correct results, and therefore diagnosis and treatment. HUGE ERROR!3. Although Mayo was kind about the problem above, it was months of back and forth making sure they refunded me for their mistake. They did, but it was extremely time consuming.4. You do not get thorough reports from the doctors. They have new technology where they talk into the telephone and it dictates their verbal notes onto paper. So you get a pretty short handed simple report.5. Prior to coming to Mayo I was told they spend a lot of time with you to answer questions, eval you etc. I did not find that to be the case. It was about the same as any other doctor visit. Initial eval about 30 minutes, and my appointment to review my results about 15 minutes. My take away is I think Mayo is a great way to get a bunch of tests over with, try new tests other hospitals do not have yet, and learn about new research, but keep in mind to check everything yourself and know you're outcome is really more dependent on if you happen to get a practitioner who knows what to do in your case, than the hospital establishment itself."
"112","Jack K.","Pensacola, FL",5,"My wife has serious health issues and she is routinely treated at Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN.  I have a very high regard for Vanderbilt, but the Mayo Clinic is another world entirely.  It is a huge facility, many times larger than Vanderbilt.  And, the organization and execution of the various tests I could only view with ""shock and awe"".  My wife received care that has a reputation for, and was proven to us, as the best in the world.  Unbelievable diagnostic capabilities and a very common sense and soothing approach."

Very Kind, patient and nice that tries really hard and strives towards her patients. Dr. Bydon and Dr. Atkins are great doctors.

"117","Kim H.","Elgin, MN",5,"Absolutely the best.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2016 and went to Mayo for a 2nd opinion.  I had breast cancer treatment at my local health care provider but am having follow up care and monitoring at Mayo in Rochester.Every single person at Mayo from Assistant to Physician is professional and compassionate.  If I have any question, I just message my care team and they respond so quickly - usually within 2 hours.  And their responses are meaningful-usually with input from my Dr unless that is clearly not necessary.  That makes me feel like I am never alone in this rather scary journey.They are incredibly organized and efficient.  If you need follow up tests, they do their best to make it happen the same day but that isn't always possible.  They get you in as quickly as possible.They don't take chances with my health.  They have done some radiology and lab work that I am pretty sure my local provider would have skipped.  While my local provider seemed to prefer skipping anything which was not absolutely needed, Mayo seems to want to be sure which I appreciate.  This is my life we are talking about.And last but not least, the phone app is amazing.  I can see all the dr. notes, test results, even radiology images through the phone app portal.  That makes me more informed and reassured about  care I am getting.  Don't underestimate the importance of being informed every step along the way."

It's still the premier medical facility in the world, but I remember how it was back before the accountants and management consultants got hold of it."

"122","Judy M.","Vancouver, WA",1,"The hospital is top notch but one mistake Mayo Clinic had made - they do not necessarily hire board-certified surgeon.Here is my advice to the patients that require spine surgery.Please pay attention that Dr. Mohamad Bydon is not Neurosurgery Board Certified (I found out this after I had the operation done by him, sadly).  And I am not sure why a reputable organization such as Mayo Clinic would hire a surgeon who is not board-certified.He is rather a junior doctor like other reviewers had stated at ratemds.comYou can easily check whether a specialty surgeon is board certified by researching at abns.org I am 5th day post-op by Dr. Mohamad Bydon.  I really cannot imagine that from the time (I had cervical spine surgery on Auguest 1, 2017 about noon time) I was wheeled into the operating room up to the next day that I was forced to be discharged by his nurse he did not show up in front of me.  My husband was with me that day.  The only communication was that he made a brief phone call after operation that he made a 4 inch incision in one level instead what he had communicated with us two of 2 inch incision around the creases of my neck.Originally we were told that he reserved the operating room for eight hours.  But by about 3 pm in the afternoon he already phoned my husband that surgery had finished.  I was sent to the patient room around 4 pm that day and I assume I can stay at least 24 hours there.  Noop !!Early morning on August 2nd I was told by night shift nurse that a resident physician is coming to see me shortly and I asked her how about Dr. Bydon she said he will come later of the day like maybe 3 pm. By noon time his nurse Jeena already started bugging me and my husband to get rid of the hospital as soon as we can.  I asked her 'Isn't Dr. Bydon planning to come to see me?'   She responded like this ' You know the Heads of all departments are very busy they don't have time to see patients afterwards (after they operated on them)'. And I kept begging Jeena to let me stay until about 3 pm.  All in all she did not show any sympathy or compassion at all.  We were forced out after she read us post-surgery instructions.   I really cannot believe this situation happens at Mayo Clinic.  I remembered last time I had similar surgery done by the Director of Neurosurgery at MGH in Boston Dr. Borges came to see me every single day and inquired me whether I got better.  Definitely not Dr.? Bydon !!!  Although he called me after we got back to the hotel (we travelled 2,000 miles away from home) he excused that he tried to visit me after we left.  I knew that he had communicated with his nurse Jeena regarding all the details most importantly including how to get rid of me outside of the hospital.Don't be fooled by his smiling face.  Smiling does not really mean friendly or compassionate at all."
"123","Tara H.","Saint Paul, MN",5,"Thank you thank you Dr Thomas J Salinas, dept of Prostedontics, for literally and genuinely saving my life 3 times this year.No one would help me.  No one took my pain, my suffering seriously from December 2016 until my three emergency surgeries all mandated approved by Dr Salinas -- May 24, June 7  and September 29  this year.  These dental surgeries were SO serious and life threatening that BLUE CROSS covered all costs.It is Sssoooo important to have the chutzpah courage and strong inner strength to fight for yourself,  be your OWN fearless self advocate... or else you could die.I found myself suddenly in excruciating pain after two huge molars were worked on by my new dental clinic 12/2016.   I went back a week later and a second dentist stated,"" oh,  you are just grinding your teeth!""   I knew that was a crazy statement but waited yet another month after taking megadoses of ibuprofen she had ordered.  Finally the 3rd dentist did xrays and discovered a nightmare deep infection and referred me to U if Mn graduate  Endodontics.    From day one i  immediately wrote my top internist at U of Mn of my severe pain-- he refused to help / see me   Telling me "" its a dental problem"".  Not even a referral....  he did not see me until Sept 11....Graduate Endodontics concluded my entire jaw had suffered hair pin fractures from my elevator accident 2/2013 when my face slammed to the floor and face crashed to the floor causing the teeth to crash together.    In four years bacteria had entered ALL these fractures thus  cracking my roots causing MASSIVE DEEP infections in at least  7  major molars and sub molars... they recommended SEVEN root canals for $7000.  Four years ago,  and JUST 7 months after the accident, i had seen faculty dental practice  U of Mn  ( went there for 10 years).     they suddenly stated i needed an immediate tooth removed.  I told them of my accident ... response of silence.  I asked them why my tooth had to be removed... again silence.  I realize now NO doctors want to get involved in treatments after severe accidents for fear of litigation....   you can almost see a lawyer standing invisibly behind them.....THIS  is a major problem.So one day after Endodontics i contracted nightmare asthma  then 3 days later influenza  then again a month later same thing but this time two huge abscesses on my glands just below my ears,  now its mid May.   LUCKILY my good brain directed me to my daughter's prostedontist at Mayo, Dr Salinas for a second opinion re the  $7000 of root canals,  i called in early April got an appt mid May.   He saw me right after the 2nd round of infection/ asthma and IMMEDIATELY sent me to Mayo emergency oral surgery.  Later he wrote me a personal referral to his friend the Dean of the U of Mn dental School where i had the 2nd emergency surgery which was done less efficiently by a grad student.  I became sick  again early August and was scheduled to see Dr Salinas Sept 28.   FINALLY my internist himself saw me Sept 11 and realized  how ill i was,  how deep these infections were,  how threatening to my brain. When Dr Salinas saw me sept 28 he did a special xray and ran in very serious stating,"" this molar MUST COME OUT NOW!!!""   Now i was scared.  My head aches were severe....Listen to your inner voice instincts ALWAYS.   Believe in yourself.  BE PERSISTENT.   Don't give up‼‼‼ I did this.   I am alive well.   Was on 2000 mg of amoxicillan for 12 weeks this year.....Thank you  thank you Dr Salinas for believing me.Quality care is very rare today.  We are truly blessed to have Mayo Clinic!"
"124","Margaret H.","Elyria, OH",3,"I would give Mayo a higher rating except for the billing department and the corporate overlords.  The doctors and nurses who cared for me were superb, and second to none.That said, Mayo is extremely money-hungry and will dog you for every penny your insurance company does not pay.  And I mean *every* last, blasted penny.  They are very quick to tell you they will turn you over to collections.  So much for ""non-profit"",  huh?Well, gotta pay for those water fountains and glass floors!I had heard that they were mercenary from other people, but have now seen it first-hand.Caveat emptor.  Make sure you have fabulous insurance (like members of Congress) or a pile of money somewhere."

It is also safe to say that they did it in the most compassionate way possible. Mayo Clinic cares just as much about the patients as they do the family.Not only did the hospital provide an OR Communicator to inform the family about the status of the surgery, but the surgeon took his time to answer all questions after the surgery as well. He was never in a rush.The surgeon had to leave for a family emergency the day after the surgery and gave us his cell phone number to call him to inform him how things went. Even though he was at a funeral for his grandmother, he took time to talk to my brother on the cell phone to see how he was feeling.Mayo Clinic is a great place. Even though you don't want to be here, they will put you at ease and take the time to explain the procedure in detail."

No one could figure out what was wrong and yet no one would order an MRI (to give you an example of how ridiculous this is, I complained of headaches a while and got offered and MRI right away).  So my family decided to make the trip to this Mayo Clinic from Illinois expecting actual answers. However, no one here wanted to deal with my sister either and we left with no answers. Now I know if my sister is faking an illness and this was not faking an illness. She even had to get speech recognition software to type papers at college.  It turns out that she had a growth on her brain that was preventing her from moving her arm and guess what?!? It was found after an actual professional doctor ordered an MRI! Shocker I know! However me and the rest of my family would never have known about the growth after leaving this garbage dump.  She was told it was psychological and that she just didn't want to move her hand. Now my sister is finally getting treatment for something these idiots passed off as her ""subconsciously not wanting to move her hand."" Do not waste your time.

Most of them are either patients, workers, or visitors. I didn't rate this place a five star because it's located in Rochester, MN. I think it is a far drive for patients who live in the cities. Also, I was there recently to pick up my immunization records. I called ahead to have them get it ready for me when I show up. When I got there, they didn't get it ready for me and I had to wait in the little lobby for about 10 minutes.

"142","Lindsay D.","Los Angeles, CA",1,"Arrogant, Insulting, Missed Easy Diagnosis, care more about their image than actually helping peopleI told five different doctors that I was so exhausted that my second day at a new job I slept in the fire escape. All I could do was work, eat, and sleep. I frequently slept in the handicap stall of the ladies restroom, and eventually moved right next to my job so that I could nap for an hour at lunch. NONE of them looked into this fatigue. Their only response was a psych referral. Turns out I have Hashimotos and a goiter so large my necklaces no longer fit. All of my dizziness symptoms resolved with thyroid supplementation. Mayo gave me an insulting pamphlet on ""Chronic Subjective Dizziness"". Yes, I knew I was chronically dizzy . . thank you for telling me that you see it as subjective. It was as if this shiny pamphlet telling me it was in my head and there was nothing they could do served as a diagnosis. Oh the arrogance. If as a doctor or organizations you cannot find the source of a patient's symptoms you should dig deeper until you do. Only arrogance assumes that since you cannot find a source a source does not exist. Shame on the Mayo Clinic for taking arrogance to the level of creating a new ""diagnosis"" as a trash can diagnosis for all the things of which they are not competent enough to actually find the cause. Hashimotos is a pretty easy diagnosis to catch. Shame on the Mayo Clinic. The second time I applied  (other issues) they rejected me. The numbers game they play to keep their success rate up . . . their ""#1 in the country"" claim is a joke. Make up fake diagnosis and reject tough patients and you could have the same claim as well. Anyone working in development/marketing of this organization should take a serious look at how they get to their ""success numbers"" . . . and leave. Go work for an organization that focuses on helping people, not on their image."
"143","Sonja G.","Fremont, CA",5,"My child had an unresolved urological issue that we have been trying to diagnose for several months in the San Francisco area. Despite the fancy name of Stanford's LPCH, it was hard for us to find good sub-specialists here who were available to look at the kid's condition holistically. A family member suggested whether we tried the Mayo Clinic. Going with our Bay Area experience, I thought it would be 6 months to see a good specialist at Mayo, but to our surprise, it was quicker. We got an appointment in less than a week and flew to Rochester. The specialist, Dr. Patricio C. Gargollo and his entire staff were caring, compassionate and willing to listen and give us the diagnosis with a treatment plan. The Doctors at Mayo, despite the big name, are workhorses and not show horses!! They do not tell patients that it's in their head. They actually start with an unbiased, clean slate and look at the complete picture. Not sure how they find time to do justice to all who go there. I hope Stanford can find enough  resources to train their show-off doctors by sending them to Mayo for real training, especially the pediatric urologists."
"144","Sarah M.","Issaquah, WA",5,"I really, truly can't give this place more praise. If I could give it 10 stars out of 5, I would. The Mayo Clinic truly lives up to its reputation. The Mayo Clinic is HUGE. It's almost a full town. I spent most of my time in the same 3 buildings but there were buildings that spanned maybe up to a mile away. I came here because I suffer from daily chronic migraines among other things and was never able to find someone to look at everything holistically. I knew that everything was interconnected but no one would tell me how. The wait time to get an appointment was about 4-5 months but the process was really organized and easy. Call to make an appointment, they call back to offer an appointment time and department, give your insurance info and then they send you a bunch of paperwork in the mail to fill out. Easy enough.I only had one appointment scheduled which made me a little nervous, and I didn't know what to expect. However, as soon as we got started, I knew why people flew from all over the place to come here. We first had a nurse come in and ask a few questions, then the resident spent a really great amount of time with us, and then the resident went to brief the head doctor and then they both came back to provide a recommendation. I don't know how much time is standard but this process took us about 3 hours in total which was completely unheard of. Almost all of which was time with two doctors. They then said that it made sense for me to get some testing done and to see some other specialists. They sent me THAT DAY to get a few MRIs done and then requested that I see 4 other specialists. As soon as they put together their plan, they sent it to their schedulers who set up appointments. They gave me a packet that had all of my appointments with their locations. It was late July and some of my appointments were scheduled for all the way out in September which wouldn't work for us since we were only there for 10 days. However, if you go to each department, you can either see if they have something sooner or wait standby. I got REALLY lucky with standby and once waited 15 minutes and the other time waited about an hour. Note - not all standby requests will happen this fast.Anyway, each of the specialists was just as wonderful as the next. The department generally started with the same model of a nurse coming in, then a resident, then the main doctor. However, sometimes there wasn't a nurse first. But each specialist/resident duo spent at least a good hour to hour and a half with me which was equally impressive. (Again, not sure what the standard is?)Between all of the doctors, they communicated well and disagreed with each other when it made sense to. In the end, my neurologist who was coordinating my care, put together a comprehensive plan and recommendation which he shared. They have an online portal where you can contact the doctor with questions, refill medications, etc. This place is just SO SO impressive, I can't say enough good things about it."
"145","M F.","Los Angeles, CA",1,"Mayo Clinic's staffs bedside manner is atrocious, especially the staff on the rehabilitation center. The Board of Directors are not helpful either. Additionally, how they treated patient A. G. Was atrocious and they should never, ever ""medically abduct"" a person."
"146","Janice J.","San Francisco, CA",1,"Aweful facility and a disgrace to medicine. I went to the gastroenterology clinic because my abdomen had been distended and particularly paralyzed for multiple months. The doctors big ego was more important than trying to help his patients. I was there for four weeks, had numerous tests done and was told i had idiopathic inflammatory bowel issues. They did not take biopsy's during my colonoscopy or upper endoscopy despite it being indicated due to unexplained inflammation. They also missed the fact that I had an infection in my small intestines and celiac disease. They then tried to send me to a 'pain clinic' and implied that I had psycho-somatic illness. I am disappointed and disgusted by this facility because if i were to have listened to them I could have died from a c.diff infection I had for months before discovering it. They also do not believe nor do they test for Lyme disease. I really hope Mayo Clinic steps out of the dark ages soon."
"147","Rachel T.","Greenwood, IN",1,"Don't waste your time or money. Asthma and Allergy department not the top grade they like to think they are. I had testing, ended up in the ER even after having a reaction in the Allergy department and then ending in ER the Dr insisted it was all in my head. There was nothing wrong.I went hoping for testing I couldn't get in my local office. But all they did was scratch testing.They didn't look for a cause of my issues.Google Mayo reviews not associated with the Mayo clinic that are actual honest reviews, not doctored by the mayo to make themselves look positive."

"149","Rebecca G.","Belton, TX",1,"The care at Mayo was excellent. However, their billing department is slow and takes forever to process claims. I gave birth to my daughter June of last year (2016). It is now 11 months later (May 2017) and my pre-natal care coverage is still a pending insurance claim. I have called patient billing three times and sent 2 portal messages. I have contacted my insurance, who says they just need a simple form filled out to verify the provider's credentials. All I get are blanket responses from Mayo stating ""we are working diligently to resolve the issue."" 11 months is not diligence. Having a $5,000+ bill just pending is not good customer service and sure isn't taking care of the patient. I'm just waiting for the message when it goes to collections and I have to fight so I don't get charged because of their lack of understanding of how Tricare insurance works. It's absolutely unprofessional. We are trying for a second child and I absolutely refuse to go back to that facility because of the headache of this. We'll go to Olmsted county hospital instead."
"150","Ettya F.","Boston, MA",5,"Food: Okay, so I get it...this is a hospital cafeteria, which means you're going to find your typical selection of sugar free Jello, stewed prunes and deli meat sandwiches either made to order or in boxes. The coffee shop stand in the guest cafeteria is fine, and you can get any sort of bagged tea you want...or an extra super huge iced tea that the guy in New York would ban from your lips. (If Mayo lets you have it...then Bloomberg should really re-evaluate his stance. BOOM. Political rant over.)But oddly enough, the non-diabetic friendly desserts are something stellar. The cookies are ooey and gooey and delicious. The apple and cherry pies are jelly-sweet-tart enough to make you want more...and the crusts are buttery, flakey pie crust perfection, even if they are served in little plastic containers.Medicine: It's pretty spectacular that you can be seen for one thing, given about a billion blood tests and then referred to another specialty ""just to be sure"" all within a few days time. If it's your first time coming to Mayo and you're not here for something specific (i.e., just surgery on your throat), you can expect to have subsequent appointments booked in various departments. Luckily, service is generally quick. Physicians & Staff: The people who diagnose and help diagnose and talk to you are amazing. Bedside manner really skyrockets at Mayo, true to the founders' intent. Though you might wait 45 minutes beyond your scheduled appointment time, you'll quickly forgive the time spent in the waiting room when the doctor spends an equally absurd amount of time with you. These people are nothing but thorough, respectful and, seriously, the best that medicine has to offer. You'll walk out of every appointment you have feeling as though you have a new BFF."

And that's exactly why I went to the Mayo in Jacksonville.I wanted the kind of specialized expertise that would get me the right diagnosis.  Dr. Mehmet Tatari came through for me.  I  got X-rays and a diagnosis the next day.  AND he called me personally.  Now THAT is quality health care.

"155","Brady L.","San Diego, CA",5,"I wish I could give 10 stars. I live in San Diego,CA and was hospitalized and put in ICU and told my entire right lung needed to be removed. I decided to get a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic and glad I did! As in San Diego I was going to different Drs all over town and test stretching out over weeks if not months. They said my recovery would be 6 months. I arrived at the Mayo Clinic on a Tuesday and they did all the test, CT's, diagnosis and a non surgical procedure on the same Thursday that week that took less than 2 hours and fixed my lung. It did not need to be removed the Mayo Clinic has the expertise and equipment to do things other hospitals cannot. And the Drs and ALL of the staff are simply amazing. Every was so friendly they make you feel as if you are the only patient they have. No other way to put it they are THE BEST! Do not hesitate to get an opinion of these experts I am certainly glad I did!"
"156","Joyce S.","Melrose Park, IL",5,"Everything about the Mayo experience is over the top. The place is physically amazing with its Chihuly  glass and bronze statues and all kinds of incredible appointments.  Everything is connected by underground tunnels, making accessibility from the clinic to hotels, restaurants, the hospital and all of the medical buildings possible while never having to be outside in the cold or inclement weather. The quality of the care is top notch.  Hard to believe it could be better anywhere else. Mayo doctors have saved my brother's life now on 3 occasions covering over a 50 year period.  The nursing staff and all of the other professionals at Mayo comprise the most caring, competent, well trained staff you could ever hope and wish for."

"158","Kal M.","Eau Claire, WI",1,"If you don't have very good insurance expect to be treated like garbage . I have been for years .I have a severe heart condition but decided to just ..well die, to put it bluntly ,the next time instead of the humiliation of putting up with these greedy, condescending maggots. They give mediocre at best medical treatment to top it off ,relying on a reputation that was earned some thirty years ago but has long since eroded. I truly hope they burn in hell."
"159","Geoff T.","Rochester, MN",5,"As good as it gets. Should be the standard by which all hospitals are measured. They have been treating me for years and I only have one, small complaint. They don't have (or have VERY few) regular GP's. It would be so much better not to have to break in a new one every couple of years."
"160","A S.","Austin, TX",1,"This review is specifically for the Gastroenterology Esophageal unit. I made 4 trips from Texas to Rochester over the span of about a year & a half. They did not fix me ... or treat me with respect or communicate and mostly seem to want to run tests multiple times. When my surgery with them failed (not even my complaint, these things happen) they wanted me to consult with another surgeon there to establish a new plan of care. I sat in a hotel for THREE DAYS waiting for someone to call me. Nothing. Three extra days of hotel costs for nothing. In addition I had several issues with care at St. Mary's hospital. I tried working through ""Patient Experience"" (their complaint department). The person I worked with tried hard to make things right, but when I described some problems with a nurse, apparently they talked with the nurse - who of course denied everything - and then I was told ""Well why would he say that if it isn't true?"" - TO KEEP HIS JOB obviously! Additionally, they would not even address one of my medical issues - the nurse practitioner to whom I was assigned (didn't even get a doctor) said ""It's too hard"". Seriously?!? You're the Mayo freaking Clinic! I came back to Texas and found a great doctor who did not think it was ""too hard"" and fixed ALL of my problems within 2 1/2 months of our first visit. BOOO Mayo Clinic!"
"161","Sal A.","Chicago, IL",2,"5star world class hospital... NOT on my visits!NOT the place to go for long term Bell's palsy. I came here for many problems and to be fair they are one of the top hospitals for a reason. My 2 stars are taking the whole visit into consideration, if it was just the Bell's palsy they would get 1 star.Now, I know Bell's palsy is a complicated problem and didn't expect to be cured when I left. In fact, I also understand the doctor would not want to give me false hope and I may be stuck with this for the rest of my life. However, to refuse me the option to speak with a Neurosurgeon or get any therapy whatsoever for the Bell's. Well that was just ridiculous, especially considering the Mayo site states:mayoclinic.com/health/be…""In rare cases, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.""""Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.""I actually called 4 times to request a surgeon to speak with. My lead doctor said (through his aid), the Neurologist would have to okay it. Called twice the Neurologist, he refused, said it would not do any good. Also, called the intern Neurologist, he refused to let me go to therapy for Bell's or see a surgeon. Both Neurologist contradicted their own Mayo clinic site and said therapy as well as a surgeon would do no good for Bell's. In fact, they did not say just my case but Bell's in general. They suggested only B vitamins and Prednisone (which I already had for 7 days in the beginning and having been taken B vitamins for over a year).Just for the sake of clarification, Bell's palsy affects the face, usually just one side. It causes paralysis and comes on very quickly. The good news is it usually goes away on its own with or without treatment and lasts only a few weeks or a few months for most people. Now the bad news, a small number of people (myself included) keep Bell's much longer and may never regain complete facial movement. In fact I have also suffered from what I believe are associated headaches, dizziness and Jaw pain. At least, after much research on the Internet, it would seem to be associated.Now, for my lead doctor, Dr Nanda, I was told he was a new doctor. For what it's worth, he was a great listener and seemed to genuinely care about my health problems. The other thing I liked, is he dictated his notes in front of me so I could discuss with him any changes that should be made to ensure accuracy. He actually reviewed his notes with me, everything, word for word. Something none of the other doctors did at Mayo. The criticism I have for my lead doctor is, he did not touch base with me once during my week and a half doctor/testing marathon and he refused to let me see a surgeon (which clearly goes against the Mayo Clinic's own advice on long term Bell's Palsy). If you read this Dr Nanda, please except this a polite suggestion and touch base with future patients to ensure everything is proceeding as planned as well as answer any questions. For what is worth, I think in the near future Dr Nanda has potential and may have patients lined up just for him (that is if he just touches base with his patients and let's them get the world famous care we go there for).Well, I could go on with my experience at Mayo but hopefully if you have long term Bell's, you will go somewhere else for treatment! For myself, I think the next stop is John Hopkins. When I called them, they offered more treatment options but of course no guarantees. Good luck to all and thanks for reading my review."

"164","Scott H.","Minneapolis, MN",5,"I know, it seems odd to review a hospital, but this place has it right. Their #1 cause is the patient, not the money. You know when you go to a doctor or hospital and before they even talk to you they want to swipe your credit card? Not here, that all comes after the care is provided.You know when you go to a doctor, wait an our after your original appointment time, and then get rushed through a 45 second consultation with the NP? Not here, every appointment I've had was exactly when they said it would be and every doctor I've seen has spent enormous amounts of time with me making sure I had the best care possible.A few weeks ago I had a horrible incident where I was rushed to the ER, I honestly thought this might be the end. The care I got during my stay was incredible. Every single person I dealt with at mayo treated me with respect and compassion and their only goal was to find out what was wrong with me and make me better. Granted, no hospital stay is pleasant, but how the staff treats you, their bedside manner, makes all the difference in the world.Hopefully, I won't have to return, but if I  do get Ill, I sure hope it's here!"

He said Mayo so off we went.We have been here twice - for one week each time. From the time we completed a request for an appointment on their Web site through to billing, the process has been flawless. Our 10am appointments start at 9:55am and the doctors give you their complete attention for at least 45minutes.  Additional things like having blood drawn take minutes, not hours to be completed.The neurologist my husband sees specializes in men with MS. He actively researches, publishes and speaks at conferences. The guy knows his stuff! Mayo is great about forwarding all their test results, clinic notes, etc... back to your local doctor within a week."

If you have a strange, unexplained mystery illness that has a combination of neurological issues, neuropsychiatric issues, and physiological issues, yet all of your blood and imaging tests keep coming back normal, then chances are very strong that you have at least one tick infection, like Lyme.  Bartonella presents with extreme neuropsychiatric symptoms, and when coupled with Lyme, you have one very sick patient.  Untreated, the disease will kill you.Your best bet would be to locate a competent and knowledgeable Lyme-literate Medical Doctor who can properly diagnose and treat these deadly diseases.  Unfortunately they are few and far between, so you have to go where they are.  An LLMD saved my life - mainstream doctors, including ones at Mayo, almost killed me."

This is awesome if you are visiting in the winter when there is snow everywhere, but a bonus in the summer when it can get fairly hot outside, and the tunnels provide an air conditioned sanctuary.The town of Rochester is also a nice place to waste time in between appointments.

Told me my referring doctor was sending me to the wrong place. Claimed they never received records from my doctor's offices for 2 months. Did not schedule me with the doctor my referring physician referred me to. They scheduled me with a P.A. instead. After several phone calls, they finally scheduled me with a doctor. I emailed the doctor they did schedule me with after 10 weeks of begging for an appointment with an M.D. , even if it was not the doctor my physician referred me to. The doctor did NOT respond to my email at all. I was told and received text to be at Mayo for a 9:00 appointment , then bloodwork so I should fast. I arrived at 8:46 and was told I had no bloodwork scheduled and to sit and wait for my 10:20 doctor appointment, as the receptionist remarked, ""I don't know why they told you to be here so early."" She said, ""go upstairs and wait. ""  I got upstairs to the gastroenterology department and they had no idea why I was there. The story goes on............. Over 100 pages of my referring doctor's records were never reviewed, etc. There has never been a resolve to my medical condition due to lack of effort of Mayo staff. This has been very disappointing and a mere waste of time, energy, and in insurance carriers dollars. Mayo deserves an  ""F "" for failure ."

She Recieved first class care and treatment. Dr. Micheal Ackerman is is world renowned in his field (Cardiac/Long QT) and the staff is wonderful. There are several restaurants in the area, my favorite was Canadian Honker. I'll write a separate review for that lol :)  but there are plenty of food choices in the area if you don't want to eat the food in the hospital restaurant. Which was pretty good for hospital fare in my opinion. The prices were ok also, guess they don't want to slam worried relatives with high food costs. If you or a family member have cardiac issues that can't be resolved in your home state for whatever reason i urge you to contact Mayo and consult with them.

"185","David P.","Goodview, MN",1,"Great care.... once you receive it. Mayo can have absolutely terrible scheduling and service when you don't have the staff's attention. My wife has a debilitating pain issue, she can barely get out of bed each day. She has an appointment for a treatment that has totally resolved her pain in the past. The procedure will probably take 2 hours maximum. The problem is that it is still 10 weeks away. There is NOBODY at Mayo to talk to to try to prioritize her case. Doctors and schedulers just give you a number like you're in line at the deli. All you can do is call every day to check for cancellations, it's not in their job description to call you if a appointment opens. Out of desperation she's ended up in the ER trying to plead for someone to help. There is apparently nobody in the Mayo system who has the job of caring for patients that aren't at the front of the line. I'm sure if she was a dignitary or wealthy foreign visitor she would jump to the front of the line. Once you receive the care it's always been world class for my wife, but the lack of compassion in scheduling is undeniably cruel."
"186","Jennifer K.","Manitou Springs, CO",5,"Best medical care in the entire United States. I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclorosis at 25 years old. We had a terrible experience with medical care in Bend Oregon. The week long waits to get test results scheduled, another week until the appointment and another week for results was just tearing us apart, you feel like you live in a waiting room 24/7. After a year of testing and treatments, a threat from my employer to fire me because of all the appointments and lengths of appointments, and not feeling cared for by my medical team, my husband finally got fed up and looked for another option. He came across Mayo clinic in Rochester Minnesota as the top MS clinic in the US. Boy were they right. We got the application sent in, about 3 days later a gal called to finish up getting my info and the next day had an availability 2 weeks out. Because we lived in Oregon, we had to push it out for a month to make travel arrangements. In February 2018, we flew into Minneapolis on the day of the superbowl, and drove the 45 min to Rochester the next morning. My appointment with the Neurologists were like no experience I've ever had with doctors. The top MS specialists arguably in the world, was there to advise the already experienced gentlemen also in that field. He sat with us for 3 hours on his own, discussing my entire medical history, emotions, past medications treatments and basically my whole life of medical issues. After that he answered any questions we had and took his report to the top MS specialists running that department. We sat in the room for about an hour without anyone there, admiring the depth of care so far and then he came back in, this time with the specialist. He gave her his thoughts, she gave us her thoughts and together they came up with a treatment plan and symptom plan. The next step was to get scans, bloodwork etc. The next day, we got a schedule that listed all the appointments, times and instructions printed out with location. All onsite at the massive Mayo Clinic hospital. We saw about 6 specialists, all in different fields, but with the same goal of treating my ms symptoms. This included pain management, urologists, physical therapists, nutritionists and more, all in the same day. Let me tell you this- I wasted an entire year getting no answers, not helpful treatment or opinions. This visit saved my life. In 1 week we spent a total of about 15 hours, with the specialists and the longest wait time we had was the 1 hour it took for that neurologist to write a report on me. Absolutly incredible. The amount of care I felt, the education they gave us so we understand this disease and our options moving forward, was like a fairytale in the medical field. It's been a year since that visit. It's 2019 and we've moved to Rochester to continue care and try having kids. Because of the difficulty of the situation, we decided being closer to a good medical facility, should anything go wrong, was in our best intrest. If you need REAL medical care, come to Mayo. They actually do care. And it shows. I thank everyone there who cares for me, I feel like my life actually matters to them."
"187","Anonymous P.","Duluth, MN",5,"I have been in remission from late-stage ovarian cancer for eight years, thanks to the good folks at Mayo Clinic.  Thank you to Dr. Dowdy, Dr. Peethambaram, Dr. Cliby, and the oncology nurses on Gonda 10 East, and to the staff at Methodist Hospital as well."
"188","Jessica D.","Rochester, MN",5,"Very clean, quiet. Professional, nice staff. The biggest hospital I ever come. Parking not to easy to get in but everything else it is good"
"189","Kat K.","Oskaloosa, IA",2,"First of all, I was told that we would be seeing both Immunology and Dermatology prior to our appointment regarding our daughter's extreme allergies. It didn't happen-Immunology didn't have time for us that day. I was extremely unhappy with our clinical visit with Dr. Hand in Dermatology. She, clearly, did not make any attempt to examine our child's medical records prior to the clinic visit. She was basically a talking head and listened to nothing that we said. I asked multiple questions and I couldn't even get a simple answer out of her. She just kept repeating the same line like a robot. She also had poor bedside manner and almost came across as arrogant, especially when I began discussing the natural therapies that we had tried. At one time I brought up adding turmeric and black pepper to our daughters vegetables for the anti-inflammatory effect. She looked at me with a blank stare and said she had never heard of the spice having an anti-inflammatory effect. And she even suggested our daughter's cradle cap was leading to her extremely high IgE levels. Huh? I think what it comes down to is she wasn't even listening to anything that we said. She was very judgmental about our daughter's diet of fish, fruits, and vegetables-which I might add is the only thing she isn't allergic to and the foods were removed at the insistence of an allergist and not us. I am a thirty five year old woman that looks a youthful eighteen. I get it, I am used to the judgement (I guess she thought I was young and stupid) but I don't expect to receive it from a physician at a highly renowned medical clinic. Our experience was a complete waste of time and money. Dr. Hand needs to read this story and get 'out of bed' with big pharma. hefty.co/isaiahs-skin"
"190","Holly T.","Arlington, VA",5,"Well we've been here now for several different visits so it's about time I wrote a review! My father had a surgery botched at another hospital and ended up here several years ago for a second opinion. They did an amazing job and he was extremely happy with everything. I researched and found the executive health program a couple if years ago and came for a three day visit. They program organizes the appts with doctors and various tests to get the most out of your visit here. I have returned several times since then both for myself and for other family members and the program has been great. The other day my father realized that he would need surgery once again for a different issue and he called the program. Within several days they coordinated appts for him and here we are for his surgery. At least if you need medical care, you shouldn't also have to worry about the quality of your care here at Mayo!!"
"191","Ryan H.","Madison, VA",5,"Wow - What can I say?I had a gallbladder surgery there and the care was superb! My two nurses couldn't have done a single thing better - I am serious, I couldn't ask for any better care!As their motto says ""The needs of the patient come first"""
"192","Gena M.","Beverly Hills, CA",1,"I am going to start this review with my initial thought of Mayo Clinic. Everyone has always told me that it is the best hospital in the country.  Let me tell you something, it's not.Are the doctors good? Yes. Are the facilities nice? Yes.  But what good is a hospital if you can't get into see the doctors?  When I booked my initial appointment, I was told that I would not need to book any additional appointments and that my specialist would guide me to the right doctors.  This happened but I COULD NOT GET INTO SEE ONE ADDITIONAL doctor. Next available appointments were months away and they just expected me to come back because ""most people do.""  I have been here for four days and have seen one doctor.  No one was helpful nor sympathetic.  Horrible experience.  Be careful before coming here. Try seeing a specialist in your area or within driving distance because Mayo Clinic is not worth it."
"193","Jasmine B.","Charlotte, NC",1,"Would give zero if I could. They don't know how to handle mentally ill patients. I was treated with no dignity or respect or compassion. Held me over 72 hours against my will. Had to ask for every thing I needed and ask them to check my vitals and chart for allergies. If I had died there my family would have had no way of contacting me. Was not allowed to even have my phone without someone watching over me. Worst hospital I've ever been to. For having such a great reputation worldwide you'd think they'd try to live up to it. Anyways. If you enjoyed your stay there...I'm honestly happy for you. But I personally don't feel like I was a priority to anyone there in scrubs. Teal or navy. Can't say they all didn't care but they sure made me feel unwelcome. So good job med city. Also just FYI this hospital is funded by donations. Not privately owned. I have health insurance. And have already received my first bill via email. It's pretty easy to see what their priority is. They need a new HR department or patient services or whatever you wanna call it. I felt like I was in jail...not a caring facility. The food was pretty good though."
"194","Rachel W.","Rochester, MN",4,"Mayo clinic is a great health facility. I did have one bad experience with a doctor that I wish could've been remedied.I have a new doctor now who is the BEST! (Dr. Pecina)"
"195","Amanda W.","Rochester, MN",5,"Just about the best, most incredible health care organization in the world. Wouldn't trust my healthcare to any other place!"
"196","Sahil K.","Rochester, MN",5,"Hands down the best place to be if you or your loved ones need Medical care. All the staff is very friendly and make you feel at home."
"197","Justin F.","Pueblo, CO",5,"Attention is amazing. No shortage of staff. Nice facility. Easy to navigate. Always on time for my appointment!"
"198","John M.","Malibu, CA",5,"Hard to put into words how highly I think of the Mayo Clinic and the excellent staff there. I have been dealing with a couple chronic issues for over 2 years and couldn't be more appreciative of the standard of care I received during my time at the clinic. I drove 6 hours in a blizzard just to be able to see them, and it was completely worth it. Dr. Ahlskog, Dr. Duffy, and their teams were analytical, purposeful, and direct with their approach to running diagnostic tests, and immediately ruled out many of the proposed diagnoses I had received from doctors previously. Once everything was complete in terms of testing, Dr. Ahlskog spent an hour explaining the findings, and told me they were the only place in the world that had developed a treatment protocol for what I have been going through. I met with Dr. Duffy shortly thereafter to implement the treatment, which I couldn't believe didn't involve doctors pushing medicines on me like everywhere else I've gone. The fix was simple, rooted in science, and effective, as I have been free of my episodes for just over a week now for the first time in 8 months. This place is considered the gold standard for health care for a reason, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone I know that is dealing with significant medical issues."
"199","Chris W.","Chicago, IL",3,"The waiting list for this place is LONG I'm talking months and once you get there the attention is on the patient. I would have to say from our experience I would rather have shopped around for doctors locally or try John Hopkins for a major medical issue because the treatment we received was sub par compared to what was expected. Their library is fantastic and their equipment is state of the art. I think their staff just has a little too much ego and not enough motivation on getting things done, they need to refresh on the medical books on things outside of lupus."
"200","Mel M.","Chicago, IL",5,"Thank goodness for the really good doctors and the current technology at Mayo! My son has had 2 successful surgeries with Dr. Stuart! He's very thorough in his examinations and explaining the details to us in terms we can understand. His nurse and the entire Sports Med staff have always been very kind and helpful. Other departments I have dealt with successfully & happily are billing, pre-certification, physical therapy and the appointment desk. I recommend Mayo to anyone who wants the best quality health care and the most current technology and resesarch."
"201","Megan W.","Rochester, MN",5,"All I can say is wow, a good friend went in to have her baby the other night and I was there when they had to rush her in for a c-section, they were amazing, all are fine and she was up walking around the next day. The new OB floor is beautiful, everything on one floor and each patient has her own room with huge bathroom, nothing like it was like the last time I was up here. This is where I'm going to have kids for sure."
"202","Koizumi Y.","Beaconsfield, United Kingdom",5,"This place saved my life years ago. Nuff said."
"203","Ca F.","Alexandria, VA",2,"Very unfortunate they weren't prepared after I traveled across the nation in the middle of the winter.  Wind chills were actually 20 below and much lower at times during the two-week period I gave up to place myself in the hands of physicians.  I will say that the buildings were very nice and only wished they had better physical connectivity so no strain would have been placed on my family.  Many disabled persons need very good transportation."
"204","Christina M.","Bentonville, AR",5,"I don't see how anyone could give this any less than five stars. The staff is friendly and empathetic, the doctors are patient and thorough, and the place is just beautiful. I will forever recommend this place to anyone. Thank God for Mayo Clinic."
"205","Jen R.","Stewartville, MN",5,"I grew up near Rochester. Mayo has always taken care of all of my health related needs. I trust the doctors and the nurses to give me the best care. When I went away to college I sought medical care from the local clinic and was very very disappointed in the care I received . I have heard people complain about mayo being too big and you get lost in the Machine as just another patient. But that can happen in any hospital. My experience at different hospitals have shown me that. Mayo is huge, and that can be a good thing. Mayo Being this large allows people to specialize in one area and get really good at it. The people who draw your blood are masters at what they do. They are the only ones who can draw my blood on the first try mostly pain free. The 6 others places I have tried to give or have tested my blood made it a long and painful process.                            If it's your 1st time visiting mayo, go early. You will have a walk and you can get lost. But there are help desks set up all over. They can direct you where you need to go."
"206","Debbie S.","Salem, UT",5,"Most amazing medical care and facility  I have ever seen.   While on vacation in Branson  my husband was diagnosed with multiple myeloma with a tumor in his vertebrae,  we drove to Mayo.   Within one week we had all the tests done,  had met with hem/onc doctors,  neurosurgeon,  radiology oncologist, cardiologist and others.   Within 10 days he was in surgery and had a long term treatment scheduled.   Since we live a half way across the country I was worried about the continuity of care.   They are amazing,  have been easy to communicate with and I have all records at my fingertips.  I'd give them 10 stars."
"207","Terrie M.","Chicago, IL",5,"I have had 3 surgeries at Mayo in less than 12 months. The quality of care I received from the medical staff and nursing was outstanding. I am grateful to Dr. David Lewallen and his staff for the outcome of their work. Mayo Rochester is a wonderful place that puts the patient first. My only complaint is the food. They have instituted a new menu and it is awful. The previous menu was very good and the quality of food was much better."
"208","Bob A.","Vallejo, CA",5,"Mayo clinic website is utilized by many health professionals and refered to patients as a reliable resource for health and medicine. I use the website almost every week and the website is usually my first click when I google search. Next to cdc.gov"
"209","Dee W.","Sioux City, IA",5,"The best facility in the United States !  All Staff is caring and compassionate, I was worried on the multiple appointments I had the first time I went, but everything went smoothly ! Everyone here works together and the doctors are very thorough ! Ask alot of questions about your condition, no problem. You won't leave not knowing !  I have Cancer...and would not trust any other facility but Mayo Clinic and Hospital. I will always recommend Mayo to all friends and family...So happy there are doctors that are EXPERTS  in their field. I didn't feel like a number at all. Wow, I actually have a name ! Nothing but respect from the total staff at Mayo...I just can't say enough ! Thank you Mayo !"
"210","Charles F.","Bellingham, WA",1,"You walk through their buildings and all you hear is advertising about how this is the best medical center in the world.  They truly disappointed me by operating as if they run the worst in the world."
"211","Patrick W.","Bothell, WA",5,"Yep, another 5 star. Compassionate people, great knowlege, a supporting community and someone that handholded us the entire visit."
"212","Marcie S.","Blaine, MN",5,"I was told I had endometrial cancer by my local doctors who said that because I was high risk they wouldn't do the surgery and would only treat me with external radiation. I contacted the Mayo Clinic for a 2nd opinion and was given an appointment with Dr. Andrea Mariani. He reviewed everything and decided robotic surgery would be the best thing to do but he arranged for another doctor to be there to take care of any problems because of my large abdominal hernia. I was in surgery for over 8 hours and Dr. Farley had his hands full with my messed up hernia but between these 2 excellent doctors I came through OK and all the cancer was removed. I had 3 internal radiation treatments and now I can look forward to many more years on this glorious earth. In all my dealings with the Mayo Clinic everyone was knowledgeable, helpful, professional, caring and considerate. I can't praise enough Dr. Mariani and his staff for the way they treated me with respect and compassion and actually saved my life. They are truly committed to their patients and I would urge anyone with a life threatening condition to seek out their help as you will feel blessed to receive the concerned care they will give you."
"213","Toby G.","Windsor, CO",2,"After much deliberation, we decided to being our son to Mayo--despite not being covered by insurance. We were under the impression that Mayo would assemble a team of specialists who would work together to evaluate, diagnose, and treat our son's condition. Instead, only one generalist met with us, and she has proven to be unresponsive and unreachable for follow-up. The only reason that I didn't assign one star is because the testing services were excellent-- although not having a sufficient team to review them resulting in missed opportunities to properly diagnose and treat my son. When we visited a local doctor, who made a more comprehensive diagnosis within 5 minutes, he was shocked that Mayo only assigned one generalist to our case and that they skipped a very crucial test. Mayo seems to have developed a very effective marketing program, but their medical services are inadequate. We spent almost $10,000 for nothing."
"214","Minda P.","Grand Ledge, MI",3,"My niece is at Mayo right now. She has epilepsy and has been to many doctors here in Michigan for the past nine years with not much help or answers.  All they do is keep putting her on more and more meds, she takes 14 pills a day and still is not helping much. My sister has spent over a year trying to get her into Cleveland Clinic or Mayo, finally she got a call from Mayo Dec. 2016, she was just elated that they got an appointment and it wasn't months down the road.  They had such high hopes, but so far the experience has not been what she thought or what a lot of people say it is.  They spoke to the neurologist on Monday when they arrived, but not to much was said to them as what to expect, thoughts on my nieces condition, nothing.  It is now Friday and they have not seen the doctor since Monday.  They were to be at the hospital for an EEG at 7:00 this morning and at 10:30 they still had not put her in a room to be hooked up.  Needless to say my sister and niece are so discouraged.  This is the way it went at all the other hospitals they have been to.  We were all saying she needs to go to Mayo they are the best, but now we are feeling so bad that she has spent all this time and money and the results aren't anymore than what she had here in MI.  This is the only experience our family has had with Mayo and I must say as of right now we would probably not highly recommend going there. Especially if your insurance doesn't cover everything or any of it for that matter because you still have the cost of staying out there along with the time you have to take off work.  You just hear so many people saying their the best in the country, the experience is like no other that you come to believe it.  It's just so heart breaking for my niece and our family as we were so hoping they could help her and the experience would be what you hear about."
"215","Cassie H.","Rochester, MN",3,"My sister and I have had a great experience seeing DR. Pauly. The problem is that the new secritary would not let my mom make an appointment for me or my sister because we didn't have proof of gardianship. The person should have been nicer but according to mom she was mean. They wouldent even let mom make an appointment for my exima even though it's school polacy that if there's something else wrong besides a cold or the flu that you have to see the doctor. It got to the point that the school almost had to make an appointment for my hands. I ended up not going because the school didn't call the appointment. Or if they did they were turned away by this mean person. This person needs to be fired! This site wouldent let me give 2 stars but if I could I probably would! Be ware if you have an adult that goes to this clinnic that's blind and autistic or just plain autistic! Like I said, this secritary should be fired!"
"216","Mia F.","Appleton, WI",2,"My last appointments with several specialists was highly disappointing. Long waiting time and very unprofessional. Will have to find a place with my myirad of symptoms( prob Lyme's Disease) a different clinic. Was told they're not dealing with Lymes( if it's that and not MS or so) and I should find a specialist for Lyme's:-) Very, very disappointing to say the least!!!"
"217","Patricia B.","Pacifica, CA",5,"The best hospital I have ever been in - clean, efficient, top notch physicians, good customer service, and excellent communication. We felt we were in excellent and safe hands."
"218","mrs r.","Rochester, MN",2,"I guess it depends on what you go here for...I am a OB patient at Mayo and I've been receiving services here since I found out I was pregnant 8 months ago. I chose mayo for my prenatal care because it has the reputation of being one of the BEST hospitals in the world. Well, with that rep comes a lot of other patients. There have been many times that I've felt like a NUMBER and that's it. Some of the receptionists have been impersonal. Also, I started out with a physician, but when I found out that it is very likely that my physician would not be the one to deliver my baby, but a resident,  I chose to go with a midwife. Overall, the midwives have been nice. I really like Laurel. I just hope all goes well with Labor and Delivery so an experienced midwife will deliver my baby."
"219","Camille B.","Chicago, IL",3,"The clinic itself is extremely well run. The vast majority of the individuals working there are very helpful and caring. I went to the Mayo Clinic because of it's team approach and their neurology department is considered the best in the country. Unfortunately the neurologist I was assigned to Dr. Christopher Boes was arrogant and pedantic in his interactions with me. I only had one other appointment with a neuro surgeon which he adamantly discouraged. So much for the team work approach. When I asked if my condition could be something else Dr. Boes was again was dismissive and his solution was to significantly increased the medication I was already on. The one positive was I was confident that whoever read my MRI was first rate and eliminated the possibility that I had a tumor, although I didn't think I had one to begin with. The bottom line is if given a chance select your physician very careful because not all the staff are patient-centric."
"220","Lisa E.","Van Nuys, CA",5,"All I can say is ...LIFE SAVING!!! This facility is unbelievable. I only wish other medical businesses could manage themselves like Mayo.  If you feel you are not getting the appropriate diagnosis by your local doctors, it is so worth your life to make the trip to MN.  Everyone there understands that no one wants to be a patient and they treat everyone with amazing compassion and respect. They are smart, efficient and EFFECTIVE!! LIFE. SAVING!!!"
"221","D R.","Rochester, MN",1,"Absolutely the worst medical experience in my life. They told me the average patient stay is ""5-7 business days"". Not true. After my initial consult they booked many of my appointments 2-3 weeks out. Obviously one cannot drop their life for 3 weeks to wait around so you have to go 'standby' for each one.  If you do happen to get an appt from standby it automatically drops you from the other standby lists so you start over in last place. This means that at most you can only get one standby appt per day. Ridiculous. They also don't take any appts or standbys after 2:30 so your day is wasted just sitting around. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. They need to communicate between floors and figure out a way to be more efficient. If you have nothing better to do than wait around for three weeks this the place for you!"
"222","Jon D.","Tooele, UT",1,"For a origination that states they help why are there so many people in the area who cant get medical help?  it makes you think that there donations are paying for new $100,000 perks and not the help to the people who need the help"
"223","Susan E.","St. Joseph, MI",5,"I can't say enough about Mayo. I wish more medical facilities would take a lesson from them on how to treat patients, make appointments and keep them on track. So much compassion and knowledge. I was so impressed. The only fault I had was with the Pet Scan department. They wanted me to sit in a room for an hour they did not want me to read or get on my phone said it messes up the Pet Scan results as they want you totally relaxed but I was in a room with other chairs only divided by a curtain and they continued to come in and out talking so I was more distracted from that than if I was able to read my book and tune them out. Also the young women that  was taking care of me seemed rushed and not compassionate. I get very nervous when I have to have Pet Scans as I am claustrophobic I also can not talk as I lost my voice to cancer. So that makes it kind of scary as if I have a problem I can not call for help. When I was finished she did not escort me back to the waiting room where my husband was waiting for me. Thank goodness I have a good sense of direction so I found my own way back. The rest of the experience was wonderful. The doctors and their staff I can not say enough good things about. They saved my life."

"228","S. F.","Ottawa, Canada",2,"I brought my 12 year old daughter who has had health issues since she was born and was continueing to fail to thrive and was significantly underweight. We came from Canada. The building are beautiful and the appointments well organized. The costs if you are coming internationally are insane and you don't have a clue what each test and each appointment is going to cost - you have an overall amount they have suggested but saying yes and no to various tests is very difficult. At the end of the day the big reveal was suggested that she has an eating disorder - how horribly inaccurate and in my opinion an ignorant and lazy diagnosis given she has had these same issues since she was a baby/toddler - Dr.s should know Eating Disorders don't start that young! So so very disappointed. They were happy to take a lot of money from us and not concerned about our disappointment or the lack of valid information we received. Should have just stayed in Canada - def. not superior medically as I had heard. Back to square one less a whole lot of money, effort and time:-("
